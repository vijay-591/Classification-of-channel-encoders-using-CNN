## Classification of Channel Encoders Using CNN

This project focuses on classifying channel encoding techniques using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN).
It integrates Machine Learning (Deep Learning) with a Django web application to provide an end-to-end solution for uploading data, running predictions, and viewing results.

## Project Overview

Channel encoding plays a crucial role in reliable digital communication systems.
This project uses a trained CNN model to automatically identify different channel encoders from input data, improving accuracy and reducing manual analysis.

## Technologies Used

Python
TensorFlow / Keras
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)
Django (Web Framework)
NumPy
SQLite
HTML / CSS
