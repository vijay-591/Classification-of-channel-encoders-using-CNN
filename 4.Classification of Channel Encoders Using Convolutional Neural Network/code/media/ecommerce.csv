Absolutely wonderful - silky and sexy and comfortable
"Love this dress!  it's sooo pretty.  i happened to find it in a store, and i'm glad i did bc i never would have ordered it online bc it's petite.  i bought a petite and am 5'8"".  i love the length on me- hits just a little below the knee.  would definitely be a true midi on someone who is truly petite."
"I had such high hopes for this dress and really wanted it to work for me. i initially ordered the petite small (my usual size) but i found this to be outrageously small. so small in fact that i could not zip it up! i reordered it in petite medium, which was just ok. overall, the top half was comfortable and fit nicely, but the bottom half had a very tight under layer and several somewhat cheap (net) over layers. imo, a major design flaw was the net over layer sewn directly into the zipper - it c"
"I love, love, love this jumpsuit. it's fun, flirty, and fabulous! every time i wear it, i get nothing but great compliments!"
This shirt is very flattering to all due to the adjustable front tie. it is the perfect length to wear with leggings and it is sleeveless so it pairs well with any cardigan. love this shirt!!!
"I love tracy reese dresses, but this one is not for the very petite. i am just under 5 feet tall and usually wear a 0p in this brand. this dress was very pretty out of the package but its a lot of dress. the skirt is long and very full so it overwhelmed my small frame. not a stranger to alterations, shortening and narrowing the skirt would take away from the embellishment of the garment. i love the color and the idea of the style but it just did not work on me. i returned this dress."
"I aded this in my basket at hte last mintue to see what it would look like in person. (store pick up). i went with teh darkler color only because i am so pale :-) hte color is really gorgeous, and turns out it mathced everythiing i was trying on with it prefectly. it is a little baggy on me and hte xs is hte msallet size (bummer, no petite). i decided to jkeep it though, because as i said, it matvehd everything. my ejans, pants, and the 3 skirts i waas trying on (of which i ]kept all ) oops."
"I ordered this in carbon for store pick up, and had a ton of stuff (as always) to try on and used this top to pair (skirts and pants). everything went with it. the color is really nice charcoal with shimmer, and went well with pencil skirts, flare pants, etc. my only compaint is it is a bit big, sleeves are long and it doesn't go in petite. also a bit loose for me, but no xxs... so i kept it and wil ldecide later since the light color is already sold out in hte smallest size..."
I love this dress. i usually get an xs but it runs a little snug in bust so i ordered up a size. very flattering and feminine with the usual retailer flair for style.
"I'm 5""5' and 125 lbs. i ordered the s petite to make sure the length wasn't too long. i typically wear an xs regular in retailer dresses. if you're less busty (34b cup or smaller), a s petite will fit you perfectly (snug, but not tight). i love that i could dress it up for a party, or down for work. i love that the tulle is longer then the fabric underneath."
Dress runs small esp where the zipper area runs. i ordered the sp which typically fits me and it was very tight! the material on the top looks and feels very cheap that even just pulling on it will cause it to rip the fabric. pretty disappointed as it was going to be my christmas dress this year! needless to say it will be going back.
This dress is perfection! so pretty and flattering.
"More and more i find myself reliant on the reviews written by savvy shoppers before me and for the most past, they are right on in their estimation of the product. in the case of this dress-if it had not been for the reveiws-i doubt i would have even tried this. the dress is beautifully made, lined and reminiscent of the old retailer quality. it is lined in the solid periwinkle-colored fabric that matches the outer fabric print. tts and very form-fitting. falls just above the knee and does not rid"
"Bought the black xs to go under the larkspur midi dress because they didn't bother lining the skirt portion (grrrrrrrrrrr).
my stats are 34a-28/29-36 and the xs fit very smoothly around the chest and was flowy around my lower half, so i would say it's running big.
the straps are very pretty and it could easily be nightwear too.
i'm 5'6"" and it came to just below my knees."
This is a nice choice for holiday gatherings. i like that the length grazes the knee so it is conservative enough for office related gatherings. the size small fit me well - i am usually a size 2/4 with a small bust. in my opinion it runs small and those with larger busts will definitely have to size up (but then perhaps the waist will be too big). the problem with this dress is the quality. the fabrics are terrible. the delicate netting type fabric on the top layer of skirt got stuck in the zip
"I took these out of the package and wanted them to fit so badly, but i could tell before i put them on that they wouldn't. these are for an hour-glass figure. i am more straight up and down. the waist was way too small for my body shape and even if i sized up, i could tell they would still be tight in the waist and too roomy in the hips - for me. that said, they are really nice. sturdy, linen-like fabric, pretty color, well made. i hope they make someone very happy!"
"Material and color is nice.  the leg opening is very large.  i am 5'1 (100#) and the length hits me right above my ankle.  with a leg opening the size of my waist and hem line above my ankle, and front pleats to make me fluffy, i think you can imagine that it is not a flattering look.  if you are at least average height or taller, this may look good on you."
Took a chance on this blouse and so glad i did. i wasn't crazy about how the blouse is photographed on the model. i paired it whit white pants and it worked perfectly. crisp and clean is how i would describe it. launders well. fits great. drape is perfect. wear tucked in or out - can't go wrong.
"A flattering, super cozy coat.  will work well for cold, dry days and will look good with jeans or a dressier outfit.  i am 5' 5'', about 135 and the small fits great."
"I love the look and feel of this tulle dress. i was looking for something different, but not over the top for new year's eve. i'm small chested and the top of this dress is form fitting for a flattering look. once i steamed the tulle, it was perfect! i ordered an xsp. length was perfect too."
"If this product was in petite, i would get the petite. the regular is a little long on me but a tailor can do a simple fix on that. 

fits nicely! i'm 5'4, 130lb and pregnant so i bough t medium to grow into. 

the tie can be front or back so provides for some nice flexibility on form fitting."
"I'm upset because for the price of the dress, i thought it was embroidered! no, that is a print on the fabric. i think i cried a little when i opened the box. it is still ver pretty. i would say it is true to size, it is a tad bit big on me, but i am very tiny, but i can still get away with it. the color is vibrant. the style is unique. skirt portion is pretty poofy. i keep going back and forth on it mainly because of the price, although the quality is definitely there. except i wish it were emb"
"First of all, this is not pullover styling. there is a side zipper. i wouldn't have purchased it if i knew there was a side zipper because i have a large bust and side zippers are next to impossible for me.

second of all, the tulle feels and looks cheap and the slip has an awkward tight shape underneath.

not at all what is looks like or is described as. sadly will be returning, but i'm sure i will find something to exchange it for!"
"Cute little dress fits tts. it is a little high waisted. good length for my 5'9 height. i like the dress, i'm just not in love with it. i dont think it looks or feels cheap. it appears just as pictured."
"I love this shirt because when i first saw it, i wasn't sure if it was a shirt or dress. since it is see-through if you wear it like a dress you will need a slip or wear it with leggings. i bought a slip, wore the tie in the back, and rocked it with white wedges. you could also wear it as a vest. be careful with the buttons. i haven't had any fall off yet, but i feel like they will. overall it's great for any occasion and it's fun to wear!"
"Loved the material, but i didnt really look at how long the dress was before i purchased both a large and a medium. im 5'5"" and there was atleast 5"" of material at my feet. the gaps in the front are much wider than they look. felt like the dress just fell flat. both were returned. im usually a large and the med fit better. 36d 30 in jeans"
I have been waiting for this sweater coat to ship for weeks and i was so excited for it to arrive. this coat is not true to size and made me look short and squat. the sleeves are very wide (although long). as a light weight fall coat the sleeves don't need to be as wide because you wouldn't be layerng too much underneath. the buttons need to be moved at least three inches in for a nicer fit. i thought about redoing the buttons myself but the sleeves looked even more out of proportion with a tigh
"The colors weren't what i expected either. the dark blue is much more vibrant and i just couldn't find anything to really go with it. fabric is thick and good quality. has nice weight and movement to it. the skirt just wasn't for me, in the end."
I have several of goodhyouman shirts and i get so many compliments on them. especially the one that says forehead kisses are underrated. don't hesitate. buy this shirt. you won't be sorry.....
"This sweater is so comfy and classic - it balances a quirky hand-knit look with a beautiful color and practical fit. it is a bit cropped and boxy as part of the style, and as others mentioned, there are gaps in the knit that make it see-through. in my opinion this makes it perfect for layering! i like having a longer camisole showing underneath, or wearing it over a little dress. it's warm but still thin enough to fit under a jacket or coat."
Beautifully made pants and on trend with the flared crop. so much cuter in person. love these!
"I never would have given these pants a second look online, in person they are much cuter! the stripes are brighter and the fit more flattering. the crop has a cute flare which is right on trend. this brand has always run small for me, i am 5'8 about 140lbs and carry some chubbiness in the belly. i paired it with a collarless loose navy blazer"
These pants are even better in person. the only downside is that they need to be dry cleaned.
"I ordered this 3 months ago, and it finally came off back order. a huge disappointment. the fit wasn&#39;t so much the issue for me. the quality of the wool is subpar. someone else mentioned a &quot;felted wool&quot;...i guess, is that what you call it?  it does literally feel like felt! super thin, itchy, doesn&#39;t drape very well, and feels cheap (made in china). i got it on sale, but still not worth what i paid. definitely going back."
"This is such a neat dress. the color is great and the fabric is super soft. i am tall so the long length was an added bonus. it definitely needs something underneath since the front gaps. i am going to pair it with a funky tank top, necklaces and boots. super cute!!"
"Wouldn't have given them a second look but tried them on in store of a whim. love, love!!"
"This is a comfortable skirt that can span seasons easily. while not the most exciting design, it is a good work skirt that can be paired with many tops."
"Just ordered this in a small for me (5'6"", 135, size 4) and medium for my mom (5'3"", 130, size 8) and it is gorgeous - beautifully draped, all the weight/warmth i'll need for houston fall and winter, looks polished snapped or unsnapped. age-appropriate for both my mom (60's) and myself (30's). will look amazing with skinny jeans or leggings. we ordered the gray which is true to the photos."
Super cute and comfy pull over. sizing is accurate. material has a little bit of stretch.
Great casual top with flare. looks cute with grey pilcro stet jeans. flattering with peplum in back. nice cut for shoulders and neckline.
"Pretty and unique. great with jeans or i have worn it to work with slacks and heels. the colors, print, and embroidery are lovely. reasonably priced!"
"This is a beautiful top. it's unique and not so ordinary. i bought my usual medium and i found that it fits tight across my chest. although i had a baby this year and i am nursing, so that could be why. if i bought again i would size up."
"This poncho is so cute i love the plaid check design, the colors look like sorbet & cream and it will pair well with a turtleneck and jeans or pencil skirt and heels. i love this look for fall and it can roll right into spring. great buy!!"
"First, this is thermal ,so naturally i didn't expect super sheer, but it is. really sheer light fabric. i like it, but be prepared for considering who you might run into if you walk around the house in it. second, it is large. i ordered the size 0 and it's a nice oversized fit for my 5'3"" 125 pounds. i wouldn't want to go larger. along with being sheer, the fabric is easily stretched, which i don't mind in this case. finally, the color. it looks white on my monitor and shows a colorful blue dot"
"Tried this on today at my local retailer and had to have it. it is so comfortable and flattering. it's too bad the picture online has the model tucking it into the skirt because you can't see the ruching across the front. a little dressier alternative to a plain tee and reasonably priced for retailer. 5'8"""" and i generally wear a 6, the small fit well. will probably be back for the black!"
I bought this item from online... the fit on the model looked a little loose but when i got mine it seemed a bit tight! so i took it back to the store & ordered a larger size. for the sale price this is a great top.
I love this top. i wear it all the time.  the problem is that you can tell i wear it all the time as the fabric has started to fade.  i'd still recommend it as it is so comfortable.
"Very comfortable, material is good, cut out on sleeves flattering"
"This sweater is perfect for fall...it's roomy, warm, super comfy and the color really pops."
"Really cute top! the embroidery on the collar & bib of this top is beautiful and unique, received lots of compliments & questions about where i got it. i'm rather busty up top and the medium fit well, a small probably would've fit better but it's still super adorable."
"This is a cute top that can transition easily from summer to fall. it fits well, nice print and it's comfortable. i tried this on in the store, but did not purchase it because the color washed me out. this is not the best color for a blonde. would look much better on a brunette. if this was in a different color i most likely would have purchased it."
"I absolutely love this bib tee! it's probably my favorite retailer purchase of all time. i'm 5'7"", 140 pounds and the small was a perfect fit for me. i typically wear either a s or m tops."
"Love the color and style, but material snags easily"
"Very soft and comfortable. the shirt has an unusual, asymmetrical seam that appears along the front, right-hand side of the garment. (the model is positioned so that you can't see this detail from the picture. i attached a picture that includes the front seam.) i actually like the seam - it creates more visual interest, and adds a little bit of ruching that helps hide my belly. the cowl neck is very well done - there are two layers that form the cowl, and i've found that it means wardrobe malfun"
"Nice top. armholes are a bit oversized but as an older woman, i'm picky about that. the print is pretty and unusual. it just didn't look great on me. there's a slight peplum in the back that hangs nicely. it's a lightweight tee fabric that's opaque. i tried it on with a black bra which was barely visible. great for warmer climates but there are so many gorgeous tops out now, that i decided to return since summer is winding down. i do recommend."
This is an adorable top that i find to be extremely comfortable. i don't usually buy prints but this one is so feminine and looks great with dark wash jeans. i am a 36d and the medium was a perfect fit.
"I am pregnant and i thought this would be a great sleep bra. it's soft and fits okay, but it has zero support or shape. i would only buy if you are a b cup or smaller and can get away without support. if i would have seen this is the store, i would have passed over it. however, i was too lazy to return so i am wearing it. it's comfortable so that's a redeeming quality. i would not recommend for larger chested ladies, though!"
This tank fit well and i loved the ruffle in the back and how it layed. but the front was not a good look and i will be retuning it.
"I got this in the petite length, size o, and it fit just right. i like that i didn't have to have it altered in the length; can wear with flats with plenty of clearance to the floor from the bottom hem. my only beef with the design is the height of the waist. i personally think that the elastic waistband looks cheap, and really needs to be concealed with a belt, yet because it sits so high, literally right under the bustline, it's a tricky one to pull off. i have a wide belt that sort of does th"
"I've been looking for bralettes that provide some support but not binding/tight for night time and casual wear. this is a light weight bra, could be a little more supportive. pretty color, with nice lines. only downside is the retailer tag on the back - itchy (i need to remove it.)"
"This dress is simply beautiful and stunning. it is so figure flattering and i can't wait to wear it. size small worked for me, and since i'm tall it fell right to my ankle which is perfect for me. i could not be happier with the purchase and the keyhole in the back is a beautiful detail."
"3 tags sewn in, 2 small (about 1'' long) and 1 huge (about 2'' x 3''). very itchy so i cut them out. then the thread left behind was plasticy and even more itchy! how can you make an intimates item with such itchy tags? not comfortable at all! also - i love bralettes and wear them all the time including to work. i am a b cup. however, this one is so thin and flimsy that it gives no support even to a b cup - so for me this would only be a lounging bralette - if it wasn't so itchy!"
I recently got this on sale after looking at it forever on my wish list. i'm so happy with it. its very comfortable and just long enough for my torso (5'3). the pattern on the front is very flattering.
"Very comfortable shirt, light weight top with lovely floral colors. great for spring/summer with white jeans. love everything one september makes!"
Loved this top and was really happy to find it on sale!
"Beautiful top, but delicate! i wore it to school and the straps on my backpack caused some pilling. other than that it is beautiful and vibrant! just make sure you aren't doing/wearing anything that will rub it continuously since the fabric is delicate"
"Just received this in the mail, tried it on and am smitten. i'm usually a l, but sometimes i'm a xl (if no stretch), in retailer tops. i bought this one in l and i'm sure glad i did. very flowy, stretchy and comfortable. i also bought the meda lace top from one september and they are very similar expect this is more of a t-shirt and the other is more of a blouse. i almost think i could've gotten a m in this because there is a lot of extra fabric at the chest which is usually never the issue for me"
"Love this top! i kept eyeing it online and wavering on size, since my post-baby body is a little wonky. i went with the xsp, and miraculously, it works perfectly! so, i would say it does run just a little large..... i love the length, and usually do not go with petite sizes at retailer because i like the longer lengths of the regular. but this is perfect on me, and there is give up top, so it looks lovely. and it is very soft and comfortable. this will be a go-to top this season!"
"I really loved this top online and wanted to love it in person. it is soft and the patter is okay in person. the neckline is higher than i am used to. also, there are two buttons in the back that must be unbuttoned in order to wear the top. it is difficult to button them behind your neck with the top on. unfortunately i had to return this item..."
"I really wanted this to work. alas, it had a strange fit for me. the straps would not stay up, and it had a weird fit under the breast. it worked standing up, but the minute i sat down it fell off my shoulders. the fabric was beautiful! and i loved that it had pockets."
"This top is so cute, but it is massively babydoll shaped (a- line) which is not apparent from the pictures. i measured the xs i have and the chest is about 42"" and sweep is over 70"". i would definitely keep this top if it hung straighter. the craftsmanship is lovely and fabric is so natural and handwoven looking. i'm thinking about asking my tailor if she can take the sides in, but that might ruin it as the fabric layout is cut and proportioned to this swing style."
"Why do designers keep making crop tops??!! i can't imagine this would be flattering on anyone, especially someone average height and well endowed on top. i looked like a football player. the pattern and fabric are gorgeous, so if you are like 4' tall and super tiny and can fit xxs this may work? i am between a 6-8 and fit a small and it was huge on me and almost was bigger at the bottom than the top. such a weird cut. there is a cami underneath so if it rides up that will show but that is so 80s"
"I have a short torso and this works well for me. 34c, bought the 0. there's not much stretch to the fabric so it is fitted to my chest, but not in an uncomfortable way. definitely doesn't hang and have extra fabric like on the model. 

zipper goes almost all the way down to the bottom so it's easier to get on and off which makes up for the lack of stretch n the fabric.

unlike another reviewer, i found it went really well with navy pants and i wore it to a business meeting under a blazer. wi"
"I love this top. it is loose and comfortable. it is not sheer so you don't need a cami. it runs a little large so size down if you want a more tailored fit. 1 criticism, it catches on sharp jewelry or belts and can pull if you are not careful."
I passed up this dress so many times in the store and finally tried it on today because i wanted a casual dress while traveling in the cape. i was surprised how much cuter it is on than on hanger. i sized down to get a more fitting look and really made a difference for me in style. i was not a fan of the way it looked so loose on model. it looks really cute fitted and a bit sexy even. it is lined and very comfy and can be dressed up a but for work with a cardi. i believe i will get a lot of wear
"I am so drawn to baby doll and boxy shirts so i immediately tried this on in the store. i am petite and only 5'2"", so usually shirts with a lot of fabric swallow me whole but this one was still cute. there is a lot more fabric than the picture lets on, but i think it is still super cute and flattering. i would definitely check the size chart and read comments to see if someone with your same size description has recommended a specific size for your body type. i am petite and weigh about 110 lbs"
"I would have loved this dress if the bust and waist were just a little more fitted. i am 32c and the top was too big. fit perfectly on hips. the lace material means it cannot be easily altered, so i chose to return the dress. i would have definitely kept it if it were a better fit."
"The zipper broke on this piece the first time i wore it. very disappointing since i love the design. i'm actually going to try to replace the zipper myself with something stronger, but annoying that it's come to that."
I usually size up with this brand. small was perfect for me at 135lbs. this top has a luxurious but casual feel and beautiful. i am obsessed and want to wear it everyday. it wears a little long and drapey but a little tight where it rolls up in the arms.
"This dress is adorable - it's a perfect casual look for summer and the quality is nice with the lining (though still overpriced, in my opinion). the tie detail is somewhat adjustable, and i found my normal size s to fit fine (5'7, 128#). where this gets me is the fact that it's dry clean...totally doesn't make sense for a dress that is essentially a fancy tshirt for summer. i might bring it back for that alone, since i originally planned to wear it a lot. :("
"I am usually a petite 6 but since this dress did not come in petites i tried on 4 and it fit. i'm 5'1"" -112lbs so dress hit rt below knee -will have it hemmed up a bit do not so overwhelming.

this dress looks stunning on! great vibrant color ( i have dark hair) makes this classic elegant dress look contemporary and stylish. when i tried it on in store, salesperson and others who happen to see it on me raved and told me to grab it! i did and am glad.

i plan to wear it this spring for my daughte"
Loved this top. great design. comfortable and unique. soft material
"The rest of the reviewers are right about the color being in accurately pictured. i ordered the dark orange color and i recieved more of a dark cedar brown colored jacket. the print is great, i love it! it's so different than any other jackets ive seen. while the jacket is ã¼ber cute, it is a bit bulky (though the waist tie helps with that) and its not heavy winter appropriate ( it's not waterproof or heavily insulated). for your average winter day though, it will be a fun option! the removable v"
"I purchased this top in an antro store last week. the quality is wonderful and the greenish blue color is very unique. the blouse has a beautiful stretchy camsiole that is attached at the shoulders, but can be removed by snaps. i tooks great when worn two different ways. i wore it with the campole out, and it peeks through the blouse at the bottom. it also looks great when the camisole is worn in. my only wish is that it would come in a petite size as it's a touch big at the shoulders and neckli"
"I received this shirt in my typical xs and it fits perfectly. i?m not crazy in love with it but i also don?t dislike. the shirt is on the thin side. do i need to wear a cami underneath it, no. my concern is holes. it does remind me of a material that could develop some holes after some wear and washes. with that being said i?ll wash this shirt in cold water and hang dry and hopefully that will prevent holes from developing. the length is fine and i do like the slits in front?it adds a little dim"
"I was really hoping to like this, but it did not look the way it does on the model, at least not on me. the sharkbite hem is much more pronounced and looser. the one in the photo looks like it was pinned back. i am 5'8"" and usually wear a medium or large. i got a medium and there was a lot more material on the bottom half than the photo shows. it made me look bigger and was not flattering. material has a nice weave but it's thin and delicate. i bought the (holly) deep olive and the blue. colors"
"I tried this on from the sale section, and they only had a 2 (i usually do 0), and surprisingly, that size was the right fit. it is fitted, with just enough room to eat :-) 
te blue is a light blue, almost neutral, with the white embroidery, i think it looked stylish, and decided to keep it. the peplum part hit just in the right spot, i am short (petite) but my torso is normal size..."
"I debated n that as i think it looks loose on the model, but if i was to tighten it, it looks a lot more flattering... i tried on the xs in the store (i usually do that to decide if i need petite), and it looked huge, when we pinched the back to see if xxs would work, it was a lot of fabric, and looser didn't look as good on me... but i like the dress overall, so still recommend. and for those who like the looser look, this is great. i would, however, order eptite for 5'1.5"". (115 lbs, 03 dd che"
"Really cute piece, but it's huge. i ordered an xxs petite and it was unfortunately extremely wide and not flattering. returning."
"I bought this top online in the burnt orange color and was so excited to get it. when i tried it on, the fit was fine but it just lacked...something. the back was a little bit too long, the front was a little bit too short and it lacked the overall tailored look that i was after. gorgeous fabric and top, but not for me. i wanted something more for $150! bought the velvet tunic instead ;)"
"I love cute summer dresses and this one, especially because it is made out of linen, is unique. it is very well-made with a design that is quite flattering. i am 5 foot 6 and a little curvy with a 38 c bust and i got a size 10. it fits well although it is difficult to zip up because the material has no give. the perfect dress to wear to italy or france! now i just have to book my tickets!"
"This top is so much prettier in real life than it is on the model. the pattern and texture are both lovely, and the peplum is surprisingly flattering. it is definitely on the short side, but i think that gives it a modern look. the fabric does not stretch at all, but i still think it fits tts. if you have a very large chest you may want to go up a size, but otherwise i would order your normal size."


"This shirt caught my eye because of how beautiful it was. i love the shape, design, and and the color. it's perfect for spring and summer with some white pants. unfortunately, i don't see any possibilities for this shirt to be worn any other way. so far, it doesn't work with any of my jeans, skirts, or shorts. i usually prefer items with more versatility for outfits, so i'm still on the fence if i'm going to keep it or not. with that aside, it seriously is a great quality shirt with a beautiful"
"Purchased this top online, and when i received it was very pleased.
it has and elegant cut and yet is a casual fabric.
love that the sleeves run longer......ads to the overall look.
also loved the v neckline.........enhances the feel of the overall style.
with various necklaces this top has limitless options!
the color states moss....which i usually think of as greenish brown......i found it to be more of a taupe.
would have liked it to have a green tones, however it is still a fantastic f"
"I usually wear a medium and bought a small. it fit ok, but had no shape and was not flattering. i love baby doll dresses and tops, but this was a tent. my daughter saw me try it on and said ""that's a piece of tablecloth."" it's going back."
"I was very excited to order this top in red xs. so cute, but it was huge, shapeless and support thin! it had to go back. i should've looked at other reviews."

"I am in need of easy comfortable tops for everyday wear. i bought this top mostly because of the cute buttons. when i received it, it looked exactly as it does in the picture online, however, the buttons kept slipping out of their homes because the holes were slightly too big. the shirt fit but was just a tad snug near the upper arms, which would stretch and loosen up throughout the day. it's definitely a comfortable shirt, but it felt more like a pajama top. it's going back."
"At first i wasn't sure about it. the neckline is much lower and wavy than i thought. but after wearing it, it really is comfortable. it stretches a lot, so i wear a cami underneath so when i lean forward i'm not showing the world my torso."
"I find that this brand can be a little bit all-over-the-place with sizes. had i tried this on in person i may have bought it in a small instead of a m. despite being a bit big it still looks great and hides my flaws well. i bought a m in another shirt from them (the seamed scoop neck) and that shirt was a full 2 inches smaller in the bust than this. just something to keep in mind. still a great shirt, love the neutral color."
This top is absolutely stunning. i purchased the white one. just received and it fits nicely-a little on the big side but i believe it looks better that way. this will look great with everything. it is well constructed and looks very unique. love it!
The fabric felt cheap and i didn't find it to be a flattering top. for reference i am wearing a medium in the photos and my measurements are 38-30-40.
"Runs big and looked unflattering. i am petite, might work on someone taller."
"I bought this lovely silk/velvet shirt in the &quot;sky&quot; color but it is more on the teal blue side than sky blue, which disappointed me. it is definitely darker than appears in photo. still a luxurious well-made beauty with sassy appeal. it drapes like a snake slithering down your body. it comes with attitude."
Was so excited to order this beautiful shirt!  and the color sky is gorgeous!  but as another reviewer said--it runs small.  it was also way too short.  so sadly i will be returning this.  i gave it 5 stars because it is beautiful and great quality--it just didn't fit me.
I ordered ivory in xl because this brand tends to run tight if you're well endowed. it's a beautiful color and i love the contrasting plaid lining the inside of the collar and cuffs. haven't decided about keeping it because it looks oversized (but cozy) and it's really long. it almost touches the top of my knees in back. sooooo pretty though.
"The shirt is exactly as it is pictured, i have the burnt orange color and love it! i received numerous compliments both paired with jeans and tucked into a fun skirt. it fits true to size, as i normally wear a small in all retailer however it is the slightest bit tight in the shoulders. i would give this top a 5/5."
"Perfect dress for hot, humid, sticky weather."
This is so thin and poor quality. especially for the price. it felt like a thin pajama top. the buttons are terrible little shell buttons. this could not have been returned faster.
"I didn't end up keeping this dress...it just wasn't right for me. it is very cute and fit well but the fabric was very thin (partially lined which is a plus) and the hem line coming up on the sides made it just too short for me. i ordered the petite xs and liked the length in front and back well but the side slit/vent was just too high for my liking. the tie part hit at the perfect spot for me at only 5'4"" (~118#). i guess i just didn't ""love"" it and would rather save my funds for something i ca"
"I read the first review on this and ordered both a small and a medium as i thought this would run small. i have to totally disagree with the reviewer! i find that this top runs true to size or even generous! the sky color is so pretty and this top can be dressed up with some nice heels and a necklace or it can be comfy casual! i usually wear a small in hh brand and this one was true to fit (5""2"", broad shoulders, 120 lb)"
"This dress is comfortable and stylish at the same time. it runs true to size. i'm 5'1"" 113 lbs and got the xs petite. wore it once so far for a few hours and got a few compliments on it!"
"The design/shape of the dress are quite flattering, flirty and feminine. but.... there is no way that the dress i received is new. the color is a faded washed out red and there are black stains all over the belt area. there is no tag... the fabric looks droopy and laundered and is not crisp, stiff or new. i am very disappointed by the quality of the item that i received. undoubtedly this one is going back.

dear retailer - please make sure that you do not send pre-owend clothing articles to"
"This one totally worked for me. love the color, length, and style."
"Prior reviewer nailed it with the summary of this dress. it definitely needs heels. i'm 5'4"", 120#, 34d and this is a size 36. i usually wear a size s or 4 with most retailer stuff."
"This is the perfect summer dress. it can be dressed up or down. the quality of the linen fabric is very nice. i'm 5'1"" and it hit right below my knees. i found it to run true to size. those with a smaller bust might want to go down a size, but the tie in the front can be adjusted. it's lovely."
"First, the fabric is beautiful and lovely for spring and summer. i really wanted to like this top, but the fitting is so awkward for me. i typically where a 0/xs, and sized up in the shirt to a size 2. it was very tight and pulled funny across the chest (size 32/a). i also found the cut at the shoulders very narrow (need a strapless bra) and made it look unflattering overall. had to return this one back to the store."
"The color is perfect for fall and into winter. only the inside collar on the photo shows the subtle plaid lining. the lining was an unexpected bonus, and adds even more dimension to the shirt if the sleeves are turned up.
the fit is true to size and the 'stressed' velvet fabric is current for this season.
i'm going to enjoy wearing this shirt."
"The perfect striped t-shirt, and the cute little buttons down the front are a wonderful accent with each one being different. i love it!"
Great look and you can wear this vest with almost everything . i normally wear a small but they only had mediums and it fit fine( i like it tied). this will stay in my closet all year round . it does look like it will wrinkle easily but that doesn't bother me . a must buy !
"This is a great pull over dress that can easily be dressed to wear to work, to a bbq, or to happy hour. i have a large chest which sometimes makes this fit look like a tent but this fabric drapes nicely. the only thing i would note is the neckline was slightly higher on me than for the model."
"After reading the previous reviews, i ordered a size larger. i am so glad i did it! it fits perfectly! i am 5'4""/115/32dd and went with the s regular. so beautiful! i can't wait to wear it!"
"I was so excited to try out this top since it was such a bargain and neutral. unfortunately, the shape is ""a"" line and accentuates the hip area a bit more than i find flattering. so, it will be returned."
"Like others reviewers mentioned on here, this dress is extremely well made. but there were too many cons for me, as well. this would most certainly work on a petite/shorter frame, but for tall, busty, and curvier girls, it just sits wrong on all places unfortunately. the color is lovely along with the nice collar that ties in the back really made this dress stand out.

however, i'm a 36c and found that the arm/shoulder part so large and bulky that is made me look bigger on top. there was entirel"
"I read the previous reviews and had hoped that the exclamations about the color being inaccurate were exaggerated- however they are sadly very true. let me be clear that this is a beautiful, comfortable piece of clothing- when you put it on it feels thick and of very good quality. and while the pattern is interesting and pretty, the ""dark orange"" color i was expecting is actually a mud brown. i think it's unfortunate that retailer misrepresented such a key element of the jacket, but i digress. the"
"This coat is beautiful! i love the color and the design. it definitely runs a little large. i usually wear a small or a zero and i can wear a small wth a large sweater underneath no problem. i might have wanted an extra small but i just stuck with the small because i needed the coat already. the vest keeps it warm, but the sleeves aren't lined so it's cold unless you have a nice sweater underneath it if you're going to be in cold weather."
"Nice vest, pretty olive color, hangs nice but...its just kinda funny. just hangs and really looks odd when tied. i like the laying piece just wished it had more ""umph""."
This top is super comfy and casual. the slit/design in the front gives it more of a stylish look than your average white long sleeve tee. would definitely recommend.
"Intrepid soul that i am, i washed it in the machine in cold water on a 25 minute cycle, then put it in the dryer for 8 minutes, shook it out, hung it up, and it is just the same as when it went in. doesn't need to be ironed and didn't shrink. yes, the swing is vast, but that is part of its charm. pair it with a fitted piece on the bottom and no one will think that you are actually needing that much material to cover anything! i think it is fun, something i will use for years, wonderfully comfort"
"It's ok, fit doesn't wow me because of my body. chest is too wide, hips look too narrow. drapes across my back fat in an especially non-flattering way. basically made my square-apple body look more square-apple. great part about this dress is that it's comfy and hides the tummy pooch. construction is poorly done...contrasting liner at v-neck is rolling out on one side only and then doing the same at the hem contralaterally. another negative point is dry clean only. boo. i'm 5'3"" 140# 39-28-35 an"
"In my retailer this was hung over in the pj section, and it really has more of a jammie top feel... soft, thin and stretchy. it's super cozy and comfortable and it drapes really nice. mine seems to have stretched out a little, especially the neckline (and the little buttons have a hard time staying closed). i'm happy with it though for what it is - a great, casual day t."
"I love this vest! there are so many ways to style it...open or tied closed, over a dress or with a tshirt and jeans. i get compliments every time i wear it. it's soft and light enough to add interest to an outfit without being too heavy/hot to wear all day."
"This blouse is a perfect creation: perfect-weight cotton, many, many details, and color, all perfectly executed. there's fullness to the body, so this will definitely be easy to wear in hot, humid locations this summer, and it would be easy to pair with many things you have already for a casual yet collected look. there's no mistaking quality when you look at this piece! i bought the medium for my 130#, 34f, size 8 blouse/tee frame. this is the blouse you will have for years, and you will enjoy"

"Love this vest! the color looks a little more brown in the picture than it really is--it's a deep forest green that goes great with jeans or black pants. a great piece for polished but casual style, and the fabric has a nice, soft suede-like finish.

if only the was *slightly* higher to hit my true natural waist, it would get that fifth star (but sometimes i wear petite sizes, so that might be the issue here--still looks good tied)."
I received the sky color in m online.  am definetly keeping it as it is beautiful.  however i wish they had made it a little less wide and more long.  i am 5 3 and could totally size down to a s but even at my height it would be too short.  i like crop tops and waist hitting tops a lot.  but the shortness on this one just looks like it shrunk in the dryer
I am obsessed with peplum down coats because the ones you usually see have no shape and are extremely unflattering. i was excited for this to arrive. this is quite nice and it looks more feminine than the other down coats out there. the coat itself runs just true to my shirt size but not what i want for a coat. i will be returning this for a size up because i will want to wear a sweater or at least maybe a thicker shirt under this especially for winter or fall. the fabric is decent and the weigh
"The silhouette and length of this skirt and length are flattering, classic and comfortable! the colors and weight of this skirt make it versatile - could be worn year-round (so long as it's not 100 degrees out - there is a bit of weight to it). it's one of my favorite pieces in my closet. can be styled 20 different ways. pair with a higher-end tee, tank, denim jacket or body-hugging sweater. i sized down."
"Perfect for work or going out. i layered this with the reversible tank in medium pink so it would be work appropriate. it did not feel scratchy to me, maybe because i layered it. great buy especially with the discounts. feel like i lucked out."
"It's a pretty top, but it runs very short. the back is also pretty see through so i'm not sure i will keep it. it's called off the shoulder but it is so tight when you try and actually wear it off the shoulder. great design, just not sure i will keep it due to length"

Ii'm not usually big on lace but this is so unique and versatile that i went for it. looks good dressed up w/a nice top or casual w/a tee. can be worn practically all year. love it!
"My firned tried this on and her first comment was ""take it off, it is scratchy"", so i didn't bother trying it on. it is, however, beautiful, if you are not sensitive to scratchy material.
fit was true to size."
"The stylist had me try this top on off the shoulders, but that was kind of snug, perhaps why it didn't fit right, it is not off the shoulders on this picture. the cut is loose, so it looked big on me, but going smaller would not have worked the way i had it on... may give it another try on. xs was big, so would need to try the xxs next time. but off the shoulders looked nice on the lady who was smaller built next to me!

colors are nice, light, but appropriate for fall (or summer!) light fabri"
"Some reviewers found this skirt to be on the smaller side, but for me, it was big,,, too bad the smaller size is sold out (well, all peittes are sold out). the length is also pretty long, below the knee, but in the narrow part still...so able to keep it. the colors are great. i brought it in the store to try on in front fo the stylists, adn they all loved it and told me to keep it... winner for sure!"
I purchased this skirt at retailer store in texas. i fell in love since i saw it. the fabric is nice and the colors are pretty and cheerful for this spring/summer !! and it has pockets on the sides! don't we love pockets? very practical and lightweight
"This is a very pretty skirt and the colors are better in real life. sizing was mostly true to size for me, slightly tight in the waist but i have a thicker waist compared to my hips. i'm 5'7 and 138# and ordered a size 4 (i usually size up to a 6 with retailer pencil skirts.) a 6 probably would have fit as well, especially in the waist but didn't want it too big in the hips. length was perfect, to my knees."
"This skirt is wonderful! the price point seems a bit high for the average office gal, but the quality is impeccable. i really enjoy looking at myself in the mirror when wearing this skirt. it can be dressed up, dressed down, worn during all seasons. the design/pattern is artsy and whimsical without being too ""out-there"" (unless you want it to be, of course!). the fit is true to size, and the delicate details are just lovely."
"Like other reviewers noted, the pics don't do this skirt justice. it is truly beautiful with an intricate lace pattern and rich colors. can't wait to wear this to work!"
"Love this skirt. the detail is amazing. runs small i ordered a 12 i'm usually a 10, but still a little snug."
"Not keeping this one. the fabric is a bit tacky-looking in person, the cut is odd and it's just not me. fit is fine and there are snaps to keep the neckline flat and shaped, the colors are as shown and it is a good length (falls to top of hip). i simply did not like it. too metallic looking maybe..."
The top as with most of ap's tops is well stitched. material is very uncomfortable. if you have large bust it is a little divulging. this may prompt you to wear something underneath to look modest and change the shape of the top!
"I love the metallic colors of this top and figured i could wear it under a ruched jacket and circle skirt for work. welp, that's out the window. this design is poor. for one, this is not a piece for a petite woman with no torso and i don't know how anyone with a longer torso wears t his. this hits above my belly botton on and i got apetite 2. i have no torso. so, without a jacket, i would never wear this. it's very low cut..the back is very low..it's a little loose but i run between a 2 and a 4."
This top is so much better in person. i do not agree with some of the other reviews about the fabric being scratchy. it is not and i have sensitive skin. i love this top and have got lots of compliments.
"This is a lovely pencil skirt that is well-made and really brightens a work day. like a lot skirts with multiple colors, a lot of tops feel like they should match but you have to try a few that really work with the skirt and your look to get the right impact."
So  disappointed that no where in the limiting did it mention this suit is australian in size!! i ordered the 10 (i'm usually an 8 but that was sold out) and the suit arrives and doesn't even fir over my hips. -- the label clearly says 10 australian us 6!  gutted that i have to return this suit because of this sizing issue.  the suit looks to be well made and the design is adorable of it only for.
I saw this top online and read the reviews so i passed when i went into the store. when i went in again i thought i would give it a try. so glad i did ! it fits great and is way way prettier in person ! i ended up buying it and so glad i did !
"This is a very pretty top with vibrant metallic colors. i would be perfect for a holiday party or going out to dinner. it wasn't as scratchy as i thought it would be based on the reviews, however, it ran a little big. i'm 5.3 and about 130 pounds and i almost always wear a size 6, but the six was too big. i'd recommend sizing down. it was also lower cut than i thought it would be....showed a lot of cleavage (i'm a 34d) so it's not work appropriate. ."
"Love everything about this beautiful coat except the way it fits on me.  it is just perfect in the shoulders but once it flares out at the bottom, i look like a clown costume.  if i size down it will not fit in my shoulders.  perhaps a tailor can install buckles that match the neckline buckle to the sides of the coat to fold in the flare.  on another note the buckle at the neckline feels very hard and fake, not sure if it's real leather."
"The title says it all....this fabric of this top is both the best and worst part of the design. the colors are vibrant and the combination of materials (shoulder is a knit, sweater-like navy fabric) is interesting. however, that is where the positive comments end on this one. the top is so scratchy,, stiff, and, frankly, uncomfortable. i cannot imagine wanting to wear it. it could benefit from a lining, and that might have solved the problem of scratchy, itchy fabric.

the stiff fabric of the bo"
"My usual size 6 fits perfectly... yes the metallic fibers on the inside are scratchy. a cami solves that problem. when ordering, i realized i cld not go strapless & wld have to wear a one of my wider strap cami's in navy or black to cover the bra strap area. it was obvious some sort of cover-up swtr or jacket w/b needed & wld cover the strap area anyway. so, i also ordered the 'faux-fur cardi' in the ivory to wear over this top. it's a shrug-like cardi w/ 3/4 slvs. comes in the plum also if you"
The online picture does not do this skirt justice. it's very pretty and unique in design. i think it should be worn with a tighter shirt that is tucked in unlike the picture. this is truly a pretty pencil skirt.
"I bought this and like other reviews, agree that the quality probably could be better, but i still love it enough to keep. the buckle fell apart, but i was able to fix it and the zipper seems a little weak. it has pilled, but the fabric is textured, so i didn't even notice until i read the other reviews and then looked back at my jacket.  it is a perfect medium coat for 40's & 50's before i am ready to bust out my ugly down north face for winter.  i get compliments every time i wear it!  love!!"

"I bought a petite, size 2. i am 5'3"", 111 lb - it fit perfect with a tiny bit of room. looks just like the one pictured. length on me was about 1 inch lower than the model. very bright with multiple colors. has a nice stretch. very cute."
This will be perfect for the mild fall weather in texas. it's light weight and i love that the top is a little more fitted and the bottom swings out.

"I love the dresses by maeve and this one is no exception. i was pleasantly surprised upon receiving this dress because i wasn't sure about the print size and colors when i saw it online, but the print is beautiful. it's a very simple but elegant style and the ruffle on the back adds an extra touch of interest. i like that it has enough coverage at the top (front and back), the underarms do not fall very low, and it is lined. the a-line skirt will flatter most body types. the fabric and overall q"
These pants are fun! i use them as sleep pants. i had to size up because the waist band was a little tight for comfort.
"I ordered this in xs, i'm 5'4"", around 115lbs, and it fits perfectly. the material is very soft, but not see-through, and the romper is well-made. i wish it came in other colours, i'd buy more!"
"I purchased these for something other than sweats to wear for a girls get away weekend. they were so comfortable and flattering, friends told me i could wear them out for dinner.

the fabric is beautiful, and i loved the way they draped. the angled cut on the legs is very cute, and something a bit different. these could be perfect for a hot summer evening dinner, because the fabric is very light and breezy. dress it up with a tank top and ballet flats and you're good to go."
"Love this cream sleeveless top....it goes with everything and you can dress it up or down! this will be a go to top all summer long and probably wear thru the fall as well with a layered sweater, if needed. i typically wear small or medium size and got the medium hoping for a little longer length. i am 5'7, 34c, and overall wt. of approx. 128 lbs...it fits very nicely . thank you retailer!"
"This skirt is beautiful (especially the color) and looks well made. however, i am very pear shaped and this skirt is just too straight to be flattering on me. i agree that it runs small but even when i sized up it still wasn't flattering. i imagine that those who were not bestowed with massive hips will look lovely in this."
Happy with this top- slightly thinner material than i was expecting but that'll be fine with our hot summers. got the navy striped one- very pretty and extremely soft. washes well. i do wear an tank underneath though bc the armholes are slightly large and you can see part of my bra.
"Love the fit of this sweater! it almost fits like a sweatshirt and definitely not as long as on the model. it hits me just below the hips( for ref. im 5-3""). im considering getting all the other colors because its so cute and comfortable. could be dressed up or down. runs true to size-im always a small and this fits perfectly roomy."
"I love this sweater!! i like sweaters that are narrow on top and taper out so it doesn't look like a sack on me. plus, it is the perfect weight. i wish i would have bought one in a different color because it is so comfortable."
"The colors are vivid and perfectly autumnal but the fit is a mess. it was overall too large, the waistline curves up in the front and then falls into small pleats which was maternityish, the waistband was thicker than the dress and sat away from my body and the material was a cheapish poly. had the outer dress been made from the same material as the lining, i would have liked it better. the modesty closure was a plus but the dress was already unraveling when i took it out. #returned"
"Love this tunic! i am a curvy gal (with a few extra 'curves' in the middle) and this is a perfect top for accentuating the good and masking the negative. i purchased the pink color and it is a gorgeous peachy- pink, a much deeper color than what is portrayed in the picture. i found it true to size. typically i wear a medium or large, depending on the structure and the medium fit well. a little more fitted on top and looser around the waist. i came back to buy another in the ivory but alas, it is"
"Loved the green color, the cut is super flattering, but alas, i do need hte petite, ti was a bit long and i looked a little lost. unfrotuantely, the color is sold out in petite :-("
"But i thought this was lace or with texture, it is more a pattern on regular fabric.

colors are nice, there are subtle flowers with bright colors in the pattern, the fit is nice, the 0p fit snugly enough, i don't think there was much give but that was comfortable enough. petite length did end below the knee as shown. i think it would have been nicer shorter but don't want to have to pay extra to ehm so i left that one behind...maybe on sale :-)"
"I like this sweater so much i just bought it in a second color! the pleats make the sweater conform to my shape just enough to be flattering. i wore it over three different dresses this week that might have felt too bare for work or cooler weather. i live in a hot climate so this is the right weight for our cooler months. the metallic threads give it a little bit of flair and the grey color goes with everything. i'm 5'7"" size 10-12 and the large fit just right."
"Beautiful color,, great quality, and great fit if you size up! i learned my lesson with previous purchases and sized up when i read it runs small. i usually wear a 0/2 and i took a risk and went for the 4. it fits perfectly. i have a 25 in waist."
"Online, this looks like a great sweater. i ordered an xxsp and found that this sweater is much wider in the middle than pictured. in fact, i'm pretty sure they pinned the shirt in the back for the picture to make it appear slimmer. unfortunately, this sweater will not work for me, as i am an hourglass shape and this shirt makes me look 20 pounds heavier."
"I was worried about this item when i ordered it because of how it looks in the picture, but i had wishful thinking. i should have gone with my gut! this shirt does not have the same quality as all my other retailer purchases. it is see-through and flimsy. the bottom is just like the picture, it hangs in an odd rumpled way. the top is very flattering though, so it's a shame! if the bottom fit nicer like their other products i could have gotten away with wearing a cami under it to make up for the qu"
This skirt is a great length and nice piece for fall/winter. i love the color. it fits like a high waisted skirt would which is why i purchased the next size up.
This easel caftan is simply amazing! the silhouette fits all sizes and shapes while providing a unique dress.
"Just came today: the print is gorgeous.  very bohemian. it's a dressier dress with the chiffon.  on the con side, the chiffon is very delicate, snagged easily while trying on. there's raw edges on the waistband, needed trimming fresh out of the package.  sz 10 fit in the waist, too small for 36d bust; sz 12 fits bust but is big in the waist.  sz 10 ankle length for 5'7"", 12 hits the floor.  haven't decided if i'll keep the 12 and try to alter."
"My waist measures 28"" and the size 4 is a snug fit. i normally buy size 2 in retailer skirts, but the 2 was unbearably tight. cute skirt though! i like that it's machine washable, and the quality looks good."
I love the fabric and color (i bought the green one). my only complaint is that the base is wider than the picture shows. it looks more fitted on the model. it is more of an a shape (significantly wider at the hips.)
"I was minimally torn over whether to return this but ultimately it's going back because the knit is just too thin. i thought it would be cozy and be of normal sweater weight but it's not. and because it's so light, the swing effect doesn't really come off. nothing special."

"I love the color of this skirt, and the fabric is wonderful. it was a bit longer than anticipated, but fit well."
"Dress ran very large in every way. beautiful design, lining and quality material. i should have sized down 2 sizes. item is now sold out."
"Finally a ""swing top"" that doesn't look like a sack on me! i've been wanting to partake of this current style, but everything i've tried so far just looks ""dumpy"" on me. not this top -- it is very feminine and flattering. i am 5'7"" 118 lbs and have a small waist -- and although this is a ""swing"" style, it still shows my waist and doesn't overpower me. it is also a lovely fabric -- especially in the soft pink which i got. i'm thinking of going back for more colors!"
"I bought this shirt in the neutral and white and love it. so many people compliment it. i usually pair it with white pants and cute wedges to dress it up (obviously with a statement necklace too). but the greatest thing about this shirt is the fact that you can also dress it down. the material is fabulous but i have not washed it yet so i am not sure if it is going to shrink (which i hope it doesn't because it is one of my favorite pieces). 

unlike the other reviewer i did not think that the"
"Unlike the other reviewers, i did not have any problem with the sizing, fit or length of this skirt. it is a midi skirt so i think it's suppose to be a little bit longer?? for me it fit true to size. for reference i am 5'8"", 135 pounds and the size 6 fit perfectly. i think the color is beautiful and the quality is good."
"For a now feel, that comfy and well made, this was a great choice!"
"This skirt looks exactly as pictured and fits great. i purchased it a few weeks ago and got lots of compliments on it. however, on the third wear, the side zipper split wide open. needless to say, it was returned."
"Dang, i got a small and was still swimming in it. it's made of the fabric that increasingly seems to be the fabric of choice for all things t-shirty- soft and thin-ish, a bit translucent. i'd rather wait for something more formfitting and flattering- back it went."

"Bought this item on sale and was very disappointed in the quality for the cost. fabric feels cheap, like it will snag easily and will stretch out quickly. did not flatter the female form- felt like a burlap sack. gorgeous blue color but not worth the price tag. returned it."
Nice weight sweater that allows one to wear leggings or ultra skinny jeans without looking like i'm pregnant (not that there's anything wrong with that) very feminine and light weight enough to wear with a cami underneath and a pretty scarf.
"I loved this top; it reminded me of one i have from retailer from circa 2008 in black and white; however, on this one, the chest area is too big, in both the 14 and 16, and i even found myself tugging downward on the fabric to keep it in place because the waist is elastic and also too big. i probably need a size 12, but then i fear it would be too short-waisted on me, for i am 5'10"". unfortunately, it is not for me. also, the sleeves are much bigger and flouncier than they appear in the photo on t"
"I love the rich deep color and the style but once again this brand runs really small in the waist. i am normally a 8/10 in retailer skirts and the size 10 was tight at the waist enough so i could not button it and feel comfortable. the quality is ok, something i feel i would see at another type of discount store. for me this skirt did not work but the color and softness of the fabric was a plus."
"Great shirt to wear with white pants and wedges. i'm a teacher and this is perfect for warmer months for school or for casual evening out. it runs big but falls in such a way that it doesn't make the wearer look big; it falls elegantly and in a flattering way.

great, versatile shirt."
"I loved this skirt on but just the other reviewers, it runs small in the waist throwing off the dimension of the skirt. i ended up getting the 0 despite the fact that it was tighter in the waist because the 2 at this length (with my height) and amount of material became overwhelming on me. it would have looked better in a slightly shorter cut as another reviewer stated as well."
"Gorgeous top, very nice. detail work, soft and flattering. i don't think its too full on the bottom at all - mine has a loose but pretty straight silhouette. word of warning: soft pink is not pink it is peach with some pink - and definitely not my color. if peach isn't flattering on you, heed this and other reviewers comments they are weighing correctly! i will have to either return for the white or dye the fabric myself to a more flattering shade, bummer that i thought the other reviewers might"
Love the fabric of this shirt even though it was thinner than i expected. it is soft to the skin and flattering. however i returned it because it is made for women with long torso and shorter shoulders.
"I have already worn this several times. it is very flattering, lightweight, and easy to wear. dressy but also very soft and comfortable."
"Very pretty fabric and beautiful color, but i agree with the other reviewer here, the fit is a bit strange. the waist is very small - need to size up at least one size for that to fit - while the rest fits nicely. it's also a little longer than i had expected...sort of looks like it should be a couple inches shorter (and i'm 5'11""!)."
"I was so excited about the arrival of my maza dress. much to my surprise the material was not has structured as i thought it would be from the photos. the fit was very tight and did not fall as nicely as i anticipated. because i loved the classic design i decided to give it another chance so i returned it for the next size up and fell in love, the open sleeve was a nice surprise with a touch if elegance. the front buttons added a bit of old charm and feminine

"I'm 5'4"", 130 lbs. 34 d. i bought the medium. i think i could have gotten the small but i didn't have time to re-order. it fit fine but could have been a little more snug around my top half. i love the length and the fabric.!"
"The skirt that i received had very little blue or green in it, and was mostly white, yellow and some red. the fit was fine but the quality for the price was not there for me. the lack of quality and the disappointment in the quality equals a return."
"Ranna designs richly detailed dresses and this is no exception.  looks just like the pictures (colors/cut/drape) with the exception of a modesty hook at the deep v-neck.  sleeves are sheer with an elastic cuff.  this dress does not stretch--the bodice felt very fitted and tight, especially at the waist band.  runs tts or small; if you're busty/broad shouldered, size up.  it has a dreadful side zip, is fully lined and all synthetic fabric (boo!)  i purchased size 10p, my stats 36c/38-27-35/135#."
"Bought a large, could barely pull up over my butt. runs extremely small. it's cute but if your not a stick figure, this is not the suit for you."
"Adorable... too chilly now to wear alone & too cute to cover it up! my navy parka or jean jacket will prob be ok w/ it though. size 6 fits me perfectly & looks pretty much on me as in the pic. love plaid & cotton blend tops anyways. ruffles - adorable, & i'm not too big on that but do love this look. when i first removed this top from the packaging it had an odd 'smoky'-like odor, but it's the dye i think. after hanging it for a few days the smell disappeared. i have in mind to wear w/ the pilcr"
"This dress makes you feel like a bohemian goddess.  falls in the right area and absolutely adorable.  the dress is very fragile, handle with care."
This is my new favorite top! looks and fits as described.
"Last minute i needed a family-friendly top for a chilly night, so i tried on a couple of flowy sweaters at retailer and this was the keeper. while i found other styles a bit too boxy or bulky for my short torso, this has a nice a-line shape that gave me a slim profile while still being forgiving, plus the detail up top is feminine and i liked not having fabric piled up around my neck. i am usually a small but wanted this to fit like the model so i sized up to a medium and voila, i am a model. just"
Love all the colors in this skirt and that i can wear it with a tee and flat sandals or a black jacket and heels. easy piece to wear many ways. great quality too.
"This tunic trumped any other i have seen this season. the style, with the delicate open stitchwork around the upper chest gave it quite a feminine appeal. i especially love the weight of the fabric being on the light side. won't have to worry about hot flashes like when wearing a thicker fabric! it's warm without being bulky. and to top it off, it was on sale and i was able to grab two colors. this tunic is also age appropriate and flattering for most anyone. extraordinary to say the least."
"I needed a dress that was easy to throw on for summer days and this dress is perfect for that. it's flattering, light weight and unique. i've received a handful of compliments while wearing this dress. i am 5' 6"" 150 lbs, hourglass figure and typically purchase a small or medium (8-10) and chose a small for this dress. i'd say it's still loose on me- which is what i prefer. the scoop neck and cut out allows you wear a normal bra. however, i've noticed i'm more comfortable wearing a camisole or s"
"The inseam is advertised as 28"", but they are more like 38"". i was hoping they were for short people, but they are for someone with very long legs, event in my tallest heels, i'd have to get them hemmed! just a warning to my short friends out there. the quality, fit, look was great, but way way way too long."
"I love paige brand pants-they are soft, comfortable, and forgiving. i love these, and want them badly. the are still tight all the way to the knee and then go out into a flattering flare-it is difficult to find the perfect fit on something like this-and paige has done a wonderful job for my body.

my store does not carry petite so i tried these on in regular length. they were significantly too long for me (5'3"") probably 3-4 inches to long. i am hoping for a sale so i can buy them in petite for"
"This top is really pretty and nice quality. runs big - i went down a size, and its perfect. coloring is more subtle in person than in the photo."
"So i love pilcro, i wear them all the time and usually size down because they ""grow"" after wearing them. i tried on my usual size in these and felt like they are too tight, not sure if they will get any looser. the material feels really good, lightweight and the stripes are subtle but cute. not sure if i'll keep them or maybe size up,"
"This is a cute top with jeans for spring and summer, or warmer climates - very fresh and airy. the fabric hangs nicely and although it is lightweight, it is not too thin or see through. ii does not get overly wrinkled either. the style is flattering for most body types and it can be dressed up or down. the v neck is just right: not too deep that you feel like you are showing too much cleavage, but deep enough to be feminine and slimming. i normally wear a size s in retailer tops and blouses"
"Petite pants hsould be able to fit short peple, but a 32 inch inseam on pants with buttons at the nottom, can't even gegt them hemmed, what a bummer. my inseam is 27 inchess, so i would need a 5 inch heel. otherwise, gorgeous, and waiat fits true to size. thighs a bit snug for musclea, but stretchy enough to fit. thinking about keeping them, but have to find big plaform heeks..."
"I tried on the petite size in my usual xs, adn i actually have to go down to xxs, i looked overtaken by the shirt. i'm 5'2"" and 115lbs)

cut is flowy and not close to the body, sleeves are narrower, but still ok with athletic built.

color: light one is great for gals with darker complexion and hair, but for my pale self, the darker one was better... but can't go wrong, i ordered both colors and liked both of them.

ruffle is a great addition too..."
"I tried these on on a whim because i liked the shirt that they were displayed with in the store and was surprised how much i liked them! they are a great lighter weight alternative to the pilcro hyphen chino. great for hot days of summer.
the subtle vertical stripes go with everything and help elongate the leg. overall a really flattering cut. the waist is not too low and does not create muffin top."
"The shirt is absolutely cute looking. but that's just that....looks. i'm 5'2"" size 6 & wears m to l top. i tried on the medium in the store, it was rather flowing. i liked it. but i didn't like how it fit on the underarm area. it hung very low. so i ordered a petite m. still the same. plus the store the lighting was dark so i didn't realize how see through the shirt was too. had to return it."
"These jeans! i tried these on, in addition to the high rise paige denim, and these won out hands down. classic flattering fit from mother, with an element of edginess with the frayed hem. these are long enough on me (i'm 5'5') to cuff at the ankle if i don't want a distressed look on a particular day. they are slightly stretchy like other mother denim but not so much that i would size down. i have muscular calves and thighs, but someone who does not could likely size down and be happy with the a"
"I ordered this top in my usual size and am exchanging it for one size smaller.
it runs very generous, and so the sizing is a little off.
the style and quality are beautiful, so i am anxious to receive the smaller size."
"The blush stripes are subtle but they definitely give elongating effect to your legs.

very comfortable pair of crop pants but my calves are definitely feeling tight in there!"
"I got a small mauve. the fit is great and the length is perfect for me, just few inches above my knees.
cute and cozy! what more can i aske for!?"
I have a similar pair of capris from retailer and when i ordered these i thought they were the same in a different color. these are less flattering and i may not keep them.
"Fun detail with the beading and lace! arms are a little longer while the body of the sweatshirt is a little shorter than expected, but that's the style of the piece. the fit was tts with those proportions mind.  the ladies at the store said that if i ordered the size up, it might be a little longer in the body, but that the arms and shoulders would have been the biggest change. the material isn't too thick, so it's a nice lighter layer for fall/spring. really love it!"
"I love the style of this top, and the longer length would be great with leggings and fitted shorts. it's somewhat fitted on the top yet it's a-line shape gives a full swing at the bottom. the ruffled v-neckline is pretty, and i like the longer length of the short sleeves. but with all these attributes, unfortunately they cut the armholes really big, so when you put your arms forward, the sleeves pull against your arms. i was trying to decide if i should keep it anyway, but for $98 dollars i thin"
Ordered these online and they fit perfectly. i was looking for lightweight pants for hot and humid summer days and this pair is exactly what i needed. the striped pattern is cute and adds some color.
"I loved this dress from the moment i tried it on. so flattering to my postpartum body without being a huge tent. soft fabric, and for a white/lightly striped dress, not sheer. i'm bummed because after washing only twice (followed the instructions to wash) on gentle cycle and low tumble dry, holes started appearing everywhere, both on the cream ribbed hem in the front bottom and all across the chest, in the white part of the fabric only (it looks like the black stripes are holding the holes toget"
"I went ahead and ordered a size up based on previous reviews, but i should have ordered my own size, as they're a bit loose around the waist. the pants are adorable and the pinstripes very flattering, so i definitely recommend them!"
"I really want to love this shirt, but the small is just way too big on me. for reference, i'm a 32d (which is why i didn't want to size down much more than a small), 5'6' and 125 and i'm drowning in this. i'm going to try it with different bottoms and ultimately will keep it because i do love the quality. just size down a couple of sizes!!"
"Love pilcro, love the stripes and the length - but this particular pair of capris/crops are super tight fitting. i went up a size from my usual and still felt tight. i guess its just the cut/fabric combo. i wanted it to be a slightly less form fitting feel ...... may work for you, however!"
"This is exactly what i was expecting. cute, comfortable and casual. there are some gold sequins in the scroll work that i didn't see online. they are super pretty in person."
"I tried these on in the store, and they are super cute but run small. i typically wear a size 25 (i'm 5' 5"" and 108 lbs.) and they were too tight for me. i like the fabric and the cut; i think they'd be great one size up. (my store didn't have them.)"
"Really nice, substantial, fully lined sweater coat. i love the structured look and the faux-leather piping around the zipper and the pockets. quality seems to be very good. it runs true to size, maybe slightly on the small side (especially for larger hips/busts) so if you are in between sizes, go up. i chose small and it's just right; i wouldn't be able to zip around my hips with xsmall. besides the price, which is why i dropped one star, i cannot really find any fault in this sweater coat."

"Really pretty, but runs at least a full size small."
I love these pants. i have worn them a number of times already this season. i am 5' so i did have to have them hemmed. i lost the bottom button in the process but there are still 3 or 4 on the pants so i don't think they look odd. i also wear very high boots with these pants so that helps. a crisp white blouse and black leather jacket and i felt like a million bucks!
"I love this tunic the natural color is just that, this is a tunic so the fit is a little large. i kept it and had it altered because i really do love this top"
These cropped pants are very light weight and super cute. they seem to run just a bit small (i sized up one size from my usual) and don't seem to stretch so a size larger than you generally take may be necessary. the thin pin stripe design is very light in color so they are quite versatile.
"I have this dress on today in white and i am coming back to buy the second color even though pink is not my favorite. great comfy, casual dress that pairs well with a variety of shoes and jewelry to dress it up. highly recommend for summer!"
Size down! i love this item. it goes perfect with leggings but if you are typically a small you would need to order an extra small and so forth. hopefully once i wash this it will shrink some.
"Cute, swing top that would be flattering on most. i love the print on the white color and it's so soft. doesn't wrinkle easy. but it does run big! i'm usually a s in retailer but i was drowning in it. so, size down!"
"I purchased this top in a regular small and surprisingly, it fits me very well (i'm 5'2"", 34b, 26 waist, 36 hips). the hem falls about two inches longer than shown on the model. i like the v-neck the most because the ruffles are not too much, and it's not too low cut. i purchased the white color because i think the pattern is unique and it's brighter for spring/summer. i think skinny jeans and ankle boots or wedges would make the look very stylish. by the way, the fabric is super soft (but not w"
"This skirt is really beautiful but i agree with the other reviewers; it runs very small. i'm typically an 8 or 10. if i get a 10, there is usually a bit of room in the item. i decided to get a 10 in this skirt, just in case. i got it zipped but would have trouble breathing as the evening wore on. the pockets are wonderful and the fabric is weighty and really lovely."
"Fits well through the shoulders and arms, but there is zero waist, and it just looks like a bunch of extra fabric hanging from the top. super cute, but have to return because of that."
From the picture i wasn't sure how it would fit. got in the mail and i love it. fits snug when you first put it on and get looser as you wear it. definitely should of gotten a large.
"I was hesitant to purchase this coat because of the price, and when i received it i have to admit i was a little disappointed with the quality of the coat. the sleeves are made out of a soft felted material but i can see this pilling easily. other than that, the silhouette of the coat is perfect...not too boxy! it's also not too heavy so that you can wear it through fall and into the first months of winter. i love it!"
This top is very cute. got it in the lighter color. the fit is great and it will go with many things. if size medium were not out of stock in the blue color i would have purchased that one also.
"I really wanted to love this t and was excited to receive it in the mail. i thought i was being realistic in assuming that is would be somewhat sheer given that there doesn't seem to be a woman's white t on the planet that isn't these days, however it was really sheer. the fit was also short and boxy (this coming from a 5'3 woman who is short-waisted) on the plus size the material is extremely soft and the design is cute. maybe if you are younger and don't mind the sheerness it's worth the gambl"
"This is a perfect jacket over any shirt, tee, or dress. jacket is well made and goes with anything!"
"I ordered this dress in both colors. the peach color is so beautiful in person. i'm planning to wear this dress for our rehearsal dinner at the end of the summer, if i can hold off until then! definitely worth the price."

"This dress is incredible. i saw a sales girl wearing it in my local retailer and loved it! i bought it in the navy color, it's gorgeous in person, very bright, vibrant colors. i am 5'9 34 c bra 27 inch waist and the s was quite big on my waist. i kept it anyway because the xs has been sold out, and got it taken in a bit. i wore it while vacationing in mexico and it definitely turned heads, if you're thinking about buying this dress, do it, you won't regret it!"
Love the look and quality of this jacket. i&amp;#39;d say it fits true to size but it is way too short for me (i&amp;#39;m just under 6&amp;#39; tall). wish these came in tall sizes!
"I really love the front of this shirt. however, the back of the shirt is more of a jersey material so it doesn't seem to match the front of the shirt. i still wear it and it looks cute, but it threw me off a bit at first."
Absolutely love this dress! fits true to size and makes anyone look fabulous
I liked the color of this top but i didn't really like the ruffled stitching around the middle. it looks like someone just tacked on the bottom half. i bought this for my daughter and she likes it. i think it is comfortable and a good top to knock around in.
"Per other reviewers, i sized up from a small to a medium and the jacket fits me just right with room for layers. it is short (cropped), but i like where it hits me and is versatile for jeans and dresses."
"I have alst year's version,a dn they are essentially the smae, minus some leather parts removed... this jacket is great, the back si a little shorter, so it goes so well with peplum tops an ddresses with higher waists (without looking bigger from the back when the hem is longer and hits where the skirt aprts bulge out). i love hte darker color, i wish it came is super dark rinse...

i usually buy petites, but i never tired on the eptite in this jacket... i am holding myself back to order this on"
"Bought both colors in xs and soooooo glad i did. this dress is absolutely gorgeous in either color... will have (do to the nice quality) and wear (very stylish) for a loooooong time.

a must have for the summer!!!!!!"
"Comfy sweatshirt with fun polka dot details. soft and not baggy. a little on the shorter side so i think i will layer a lace cami underneath and it will look even prettier. i'm 5'7"", 140 pounds with an athletic, hourglass shape, 32dd. i bought the ""2"" which equates to a medium since i wanted it a little looser being a sweatshirt (i'm normally an retailer small but i don't think that would have worked in this case as it would have been too fitted). great comfy weekend piece!"
"I could wear this every day, it is stylish and comfortable"
Pretty top. love the color and the large ruffle. makes it great for layering or with a pretty necklace.
"Love this top!
it is a full/ swing top, but the slightly shorter length balances out the fullness perfectly.
i have been wearing it with a contrasting fitted cami and get tons of compliments.
love both colors, and having fun wearing them.
and after one washing the fullness is softer and looks like the pic.
runs true to size and in the arms slightly tight, so i went with my usual med and fits perfect.
if you have issues with sleeve size would recommend going up a size, otherwise very true to size"
"The styling of this top is really cute. it fits perfectly on the shoulders and gets bigger at the hem for the baby doll look. my biggest complaint is the quality! it's really cheap and feels like the quality i would expect to see at a cheap retailer. it catches lint like crazy and because the hem is just a pearl edge, it curls really badly. i buy quite a bit from here and this is the worst quality item i have seen in a long time. not worth the $$ if paying full price."
"Love, love, love this dress. it is very slimming. it hugs you without really touching you. leaving the tie and a few buttons open gives it more of a casual feel."
"I'm 5'3 130# with a 32dd bust. i usually wear small in retailer/ cloth and stone/ running horses. the small fit me fine, but with no room for layers underneath. the small was very snug. would be perfect for california evenings. but, i live in the north east! the medium still has a great shape on me, still fitted at the waist (27inches), but enough room to wear a light sweater or flannel under. the medium still also looks great over my maxi dress."
"This dress is gorgeous!!! i love it! i bought it to wear to a july wedding. i got the navy and it is so fresh and crisp in color. the sizing is on spot! i slipped it on and it was comfortable, easy and stylish. i am 5'7"" and typically xs. it falls exactly as portrayed in the online photos. it is lined in the skirt and the top is stretch jersey in the best weight! i am in love!"
"This shirt is one of my favorite retailer purchases ever! it is well made and is perfect for work or the weekend. the first time i wore it, i received so many compliments!"
"I want to live in this sweatshirt. it's so comfy, but also well-cut and lays nicely, not boxy at all. i'm typically a 10-12 or l in tops and the 3 is roomy without looking sloppy."
"I liked this top even though it was a definite 'swing' style. i ended up altering it to remove some of the fullness.
looks great with jeans as well as black pants for a dressier look. very soft and comfortable fabric. wish it was just a little bit longer."
"After missing out on last year's similar dress, i am so glad i finally purchased this one! it is beautiful in person. i bought to wear to a wedding, but i am curious if others think it might be too white? i bought the peach color. i will keep this dress no matter what. hope they come out with more next season!"
"Like the other reviewer said this top is extremely wide and boxy. it must be pinned in the picture online. it's very frustrating when they do that. thank goodness i didn't pay for shipping! for reference, i'm 5'2 and 135 pounds and bought the xxs, it's going back for sure. i'm trying to lose baby weight, not trying to look pregnant!"
I read the reviews and because this jacket is pilcro i took a chance. i was thrilled when i rceived this jacket. darker color of denim with weathered edges. i absolutely love it. don't let it get away. great jean jackets are hard to come by.
"I wanted to love this sweatshirt, but alas, it is going back. upon opening and unfolding, the first thing i noticed: the dots and not solid. they are sort of distressed looking, with parts of them missing. secondly, it doesn't have a lot of structure. it's soft and kind of floppy but in a weird way. it's just not flattering on me. it looks more like a pajama top than something i would wear out of the house. for reference, i ordered the 3, and i'm usually a 10/12 in tops."
"Love this denim jacket (also have it in white) the reason i didn't give it 5 stars all around is the distressing is just a bit too much (none on the back which is kind of strange). i'd love it even more if it wasn't distressed at all, then it could be dressed up much more for work. but overall it's my favorite, great fit and a bit of stretch so very comfy. please make this in some other denim colors!"
The cut is brilliant-the wash is subtle-the weight of the denim is sturdy but not stuff-and the stretch is just right. love it. the perfect staple. a scarf in the fall and rolled sleeves in the spring.
Love it; the bit of stretch in the denim makes it less stiff than traditional denim.
I love these. i'm between a 29 and 30 and as the 30s were sold out i had to go with the 29s. they fit well. as expected. very nice fabric. good design. have to wear a short shirt or one tucked in. fabric has a bit of stretch which is also nice.
"I've been looking at this jacket on line and finally went to the store to try it on. i really liked the styling but the denim was quite stiff. i'd prefer a softer kind of fabric. i wonder if it would soften if it was washed. also, it ran surprisingly small. i usually take an xsmall or small but the small didn't leave me enough room to comfortably bend my arms. the medium worked better. i wonder how others feel about the fabric and and the sizing. i think i'll wait and see if this one goes on sal"
"I lost my favorite denim jacket on a trip a few years ago and haven't found one i really liked again...until now. great quality - just heavy enough but not too heavy, just stretchy enough but not too stretchy, great color/design. no complaints. i read the other reviews and was happy to have ordered one size larger than my normal. i typically take a small but the medium in this is perfect. it is possible i actually like this jacket better than the one i lost several years ago, which is a big endo"
"Beautiful colors and silhouette (i got the navy). the skirt is lined and flows wonderfully when you walk. i've gotten a ton of compliments on it. i'm 5'9"" and the high hem falls a few inches below my knee, and the low hem falls to my ankles."
I love these culottes and i think they will be everywhere this coming spring / summer. the high waist is perfect and looks great with shorter shirts or tucked-in. the denim is high quality and a nice medium dark color.
I'm glad i listened to the other reviewers...i ordered a large instead of my usual medium. it's roomy enough for a sweater underneath. i love the denim! it's very soft and has some stretch. my other denim jackets are stiff even after years of washing. i also love the darker denim.

"I'm 5'4"" 125 lbs ordered small. fits perfect. super soft denim. love the color love the worn in feel"
"This dress is stunning- vibrant colors and flirty feel to it. i got the small and i am a 34b/27 pants, 132 lbs- great fit. i only question two things- am i tall enough to pull off the extra fabric in the back and what the heck do you where for a bra? those two considerations are why i didn't give it 5 stars."
"I have been searching for the perfect denim jacket and this it! i love the darker color, more modern day less 80s. it runs a little small. i am always either a s or xs at retailer. lately, their clothes seem to be running a little bigger, so i have been an xs in most tops. when i order online, i never know which size to get. i ordered an xs, however it was very tight in the arms and across the shoulders. i wanted to be able to roll the sleeves up, so i returned it for a s and it fits great. i was"
I have received so many compliments. it's my favorite
"I wore this dress for the first time yesterday... i have never received so many compliments on a dress before! several people even stopped me in the streets of nyc to tell me how beautiful this dress was!
it is an absolute must-have!"
I love the pattern on this jacket and enjoy the bell shape. a fun jacket to through on and add quick style to a skinny pants.
"I love this little jean jacket! i am petite and usually get a xxsp , but went for a size up. i'm glad i did. it fits a little snug. the color is true to the photo and the material is a medium to heavy denim. the arm length in the petite size is perfect for me. i love this - over maxi dresses, tanks, etc... adorable jacket - great buy!!"
"This dress first caught my eye online. due to the price i resisted. then i saw in store and tried on...i decided to hold off for a sale, but my will was getting thin. once i saw it start to sell out online, i had to take the plunge. i knew this dress was a must have. it is super flattering and comfy! the best of both worlds. i'm small-chested so both the s and m fit, but the seam on the s fit a bit higher, which was more flattering on me, so s is what i got. it can be dressed up or slightly down"
"I love this blouse! i just bought it recently and have yet to wear it out other than trying it on. this blouse looked very nice on me which can be challenging. i don't live near an retailer so i have to order online exclusively. i have larger hips (135lbs, 5'6) and finding flattering tops can be tough. sometimes they look amazing online and then once i try them on, they just don't look right. some shirts have a tendency to accentuate my hips too much making me look shorter. this top looked great a"
First i ordered a m. i'm normally a 8-10. the m was too small so i returned and ordered a lg. the lg fits great but there is a huge area of distressing on the shoulder that will turn into a hole. i love this jacket but cannot keep it in its condition. hopefully i will make it to the store soon (there are none w/in an hour of me) and look before i buy.
"I purchased the navy color of this dress. not only did it look good, but felt good as well. since it is for a wedding, i also purchased a white crochet cropped ""sweater"" to wear over as well, making the perfect dress for the mother of the groom. could not have been happier."
"This top looks pretty much like it does not the model. the sleeves are a nice length and are not too tight. the fabric is light weight, but not see-through. it does not wrinkle a lot. i've gotten several compliments on it and it goes with lots of different bottoms and will work under jackets too. the v-neck is pretty deep, but doesn't show so much cleavage that you couldn't wear it to work."
"Looks beautiful online but has too much material and the zipper catches on the lace. also runs very large, i am normally a small but would need and xs in this dress"
True to size on the neckline and arms but extremely large and puffy in the torso. very unflattering cut!
"I purchased the floral patterned version and get complimented every time i wear it. i found it to be pretty true to size, even after washing. it's a little sheer, so you'd definitely want to wear a camisole underneath for work. it's a great top for spring/summer!"
"I thought this top was adorable in the store and online. it just didn't work for me. although it fit, it flares out too much in the front and just wasn't flattering on me. i am 5' 5"" and 128 lbs. and ordered the small."
"Love this top! made with 100% cotton, a vintage look, and flattering details this top is a winner for me. i think it fits true to size (got my regular size 0) and i did not need the petite and i am fairly short (5'3""). it is somewhat see through, but with wearing a nude bra and not wearing it to work, i think it can be worn without a cami. the perfect lightweight, comfortable, standout piece for the summer time :)"
"I really like this blouse a lot. very very easy to wear!! i wore with pencil skirt to work and with skort as shown similar on model with sandals on weekend. very flattering and great blue color!!! very happy with this purchase. highly recommend. i am 5'6"" short torso and my usual 6 worked."
I just purchased this beautiful printed blouse in the pink color and love it! i almost always wear a size small at retailer (34d-27-35) and the fit and length are both perfect on me. if you are smaller chested you can easily go down a size. i absolutely had to have this whe i first saw it at the store and noticed how popular it was as i had to order it due to it selling out like hot cakes there. what i like about it is the texture and the ruffles at the front plus the length of the sleeves stop ri
Bought this on a whim and it exceeded my expectations. i didn't know what to expect with the quality of the fabric but this is incredibly soft and warm. haven't worn it outside yet but i can see this already as one of my favorite items. i'm usually an extra-small but the xxs also fits. it's a great buy especially since it's on sale now.
"This is an awesome vest - so soft, cozy, and i cannot wait to wear it through fall and winter. for sake of not repeating all the positive aspects that the previous reviewers did, i'll mention the one flaw...no pockets :( still totally worth full price in my mind though."
"I find that maeve shirts tend to run a little small. i'm usually an 8 but needed this in a 10. this shirt is reallly just perfect. great sleeve length. just the right amount of v neck. beautiful pattern with a vintage feel. i love the combo of stripes, polka dots and sweet flowers."
"This blouse is so pretty. i love the long tie. the pattern is very unique. it is a thin, light weight fabric so you can easily wear it underneath a leather jacket."
"This is a beautiful blouse...sheer and feminine. i am small busted and slender so i need a size smaller than usual. it is a full top...can't tell exactly how full in the photos but with a small chest there is just too much under the arms. so if your chest is more ample you could prob order your regular size. this is supposed to be a full, shorter fit...i would say the style is going to look better on someone who is a little taller with a medium sized bust rather than someone who is shorter and b"

"The photo of these is truly misleading - they are a beautiful vibrant print - see the close-up photo. they are much longer on a regular person - they come a few inches above my ankle and i am 5'5""there is a neat slit off to the side on the front of each (like a pleat) that really allows a nice flow. these look great with boots, flats and do sit lower on the waste as i think they run slightly large. not lined, but drape beautifully. there are pockets (sewn closed upon purchase) and pack pockets."
"Like another reviewer mentioned, this shirt is way too short. i'm only 5'2"" (xs) and there is no way this top would tuck in like on the model. also, the quality isn't great as it's very thin and there are strings hanging from some of the seams in the front. it's a shame b/c the print is really pretty and there is this cute little bicycle charm on the tag which makes it feel more unique. sadly, it's going back!"
"I didn't think anything of this top online (i really don't care for how they styled it) but in store it was more interesting. i'm currently anywhere between a 2-4-6 / xs-s-m, depending on the style, 5'3"" 120lb 34b. size 2 regular in this top fit me perfectly. for some reason, on me, the sleeves were elongating and flattering (closer to my elbow) and the overall length hit me perfectly at the hip like on the model, the fabric is lightweight and therefore slightly sheer but, due to the color and p"
Nice fabric and cute design. a little low cut.
"I absolutely love this sweater!! it's soft, easy to wash, and looks great!"
The blue motif is a gorgeous indigo with an interesting pattern. a short tunic that drapes nicely and is flattering. very happy with this purchase. i plan to buy a 2nd for my mom to keep her cool and stylish.
"I had high hopes for this top. really boxy, short"
"This dress has potential, but it didn't work for me. it runs true to size to a little big, i ordered medium, my usual size for maeve). as for length it fit me as the model (5'9""). the reason i'm not keeping it is that i wish it had some darts in the back to help define the waist a bit,"
I love this tee! the material is thick but not too thick. it's highly flattering- i love that the sleeves are a longer short sleeve to cover up the bingo wings. the shimmer on the front adds something special.
"I got this top in the black and i love it. the bottom is a silky material that's really beautiful, and the cutout details are really pretty. so many of retailer's sweaters are enormous, but this one fits tts. 

my one complaint is that the bottom white part wrinkles really easily."
"This top was way too short (i'm only 5'1) and way too wide. the cut of this top was so wide, it looked like a tent on me. i really wanted to love this top because the material and style (sleeves, ruffle) are beautiful, unfortunately there is something wrong with the cut. i've have several blouses made by one fine day, which fit nicely, for some reason this top did not. i ordered in my usual s size, even going to an xs would not work because the cut is wrong."
My daughter and i both purchased this vest at an retailer store. this vest is so flattering on and is so much cuter in person than in the online picture. it is chic and stylish and will definitely be a staple for fall and winter.
"This is a great piece to help ease on in to the chillier days of fall and winter. it's versatile- i can see myself wearing it with plain short or long sleeved tees or even tops with more elaborate padderns or button downs! there's so many options i cannot wait to put this gorgeous piece to use! just as an fyi, the sleeve openings are slightly unfinished and have a frayed effect to them. this may not even be noticeable if you're not looking right up close. for me, this adds to the unique quality"
"I just got this dress in the mail today and it is even better in person! the description didn't give as much information as i wanted so i'm going to be very detailed in this review. i did take off one star for quality because some of the beads are already loose (two fell off when i picked the dress up for the first time), and i'll have to hand sew others on more tightly. my usual size is a pxs or p0, and there were no petite sizes available. however the size 0 fits perfectly, no alterations need"
"When i received this blouse, ai noticed that there were gold dots all over the blouse and they were very sticky. some of the fabric would stick to these dots. i thought it was because the weather was sticky and humid. however, after hanging on my closet door, the dots are still sticky. i do love the design and fabric so i will try not to let the sticky dots bother me."
"Wasn't sure about this top based on reviews, but glad i purchased! pretty print, looks great with denim. very loose, flowy top. hangs a little short, but that's the style of this blouse. fit true to size. i usually wear a 2/4 and xs/sm with 30dd. size small worked for me."
Ordered the shirt online. beautiful print and good quality material. runs very large - size down 1 may be 2 sizes as the material on the body is very wide. i will be exchanging it in the store.
This too is so beautiful in person. there is gold dots all over the blouse that are not overwhelming. i love this top with business attire and denim. fits tts.

"I tried this in the store and i like it - nice and soft, good basic design that will pair with many pieces. but i decided to wait because of the price. i'm sure i would get a lot of use out of this top, but ultimately it didn't thrill me enough to make it my top priority purchase. i bought a sweater that was on sale instead. still, a very nice top. i may buy it eventually, especially if it goes on sale."
Gorgeous in every way except its length and how it hangs at the bottom. i prefer a shirt i can wear tucked in or out. this one will work well tucked in but not out so i am returning disappointed it was so well done in other particulars.

"I bought this in a petite size s after trying on the regular size in the store. it was a good move because the proportions in length and width are more flattering. the pattern is busy but works well with patterns in the same color group. it has no finished seams on any edge but that makes it drape nicely. it is a soft, soft fabric, almost fleece-like but not plush."
I love how soft the sweater materials is and that the built in layer piece falls so nicely. i purchased a small in black and have already worn it with jeans and heels for a dinner and with cropped work pants for the office. the bottom piece does wrinkle a lot but you can easily smooth it out. really quality materials and on sale this is quite a steal!
"I am 5.6"", 138 pounds. i purchased this in a size small. it is flowy and not too short. it has a comfortable, but still feminine and beautiful fit. one of my favorite new blouses...the red print is gorgeous"
"This top light and airy, which is perfect for spring. i'm usually into these types of blouses; however, this didn't quite fit right on me. it's a little too boxy and too low cut in the front for some reason. i loved the design and really wanted to like it... i just didn't love it enough to purchase it."
"This blouse is so beautiful - the collar, sleeves, material...everything except the cut! it was like a tent. it needed to be more tapered, which would be easy to do while still maintaining the beautiful breezy flow, and be about two inches longer.

i had been drooling over this top for awhile and was so disappointed! please fix it and then i will buy again. i am 5'4"", 140lbs and busty...a small was perfect, with the exception of the massive amount of material."
"Very pretty blouse. i love the print, and color of the pink floral. tts, i ordered the xs, because of the roomy cut of the blouse. i'm 5'8"", 117 lbs. it fit great. the cut is a little wider then pictured, but still cute. not to short as mentioned by another review, and i have a longer torso, i wasn't crazy about the victorian collar, so tucked it under, and it looks great!"
"I normally wear a large or extra-large; the medium is still very billowy on me. this blouse is ethereal and lovely, though - pretty and funky at the same time. it's sheer but somehow not revealing. perfect for when you want to look composed and cool on the hottest day of the summer."
"Not a coat by any means, merely a thin wool boucle like sweater with a cheap thin synthetic lining ---and i also would never want the lining to be seen by anyone if i were to set the sweater on a chair or be helped in putting the thing on. the length and bulk is hard to layer under anything else and isn't pretty enough for a spring coat..sizing is also 2 sizes larger than anticipated."
"I saw this in-store, tried it on, and was sold. it is not just super soft but very flattering on. i am petite, 105 lbs and bought the xs in black- the sleeves are short enough that no petite size was needed. i will wear this a lot with both skirts and jeans."
"Love this. it's heavy/warm, stylish and a great throw on any outfit. oversized style."
"The fabric was nothing special (i usually like a cotton/silk blend woven fabric, but this was stiff feeling) and the pattern was cute. but what made me return it was the fact that 1) the rose gold glitter dots are puffy paint. literally. puffy. paint. and 2) the dots were not quite dry on my top when it arrived. parts of the paint came off on my fingers and the top was stuck to itself because of it. i could barely unfold it.

i'm sure this could have been cute, but who wants a top that looks lik"
Tts. i'm wearing a small. the black goes with so many of my charlie print pants. washed nicely. layers flat to dry. had to iron the shell underneath. great for casual office.
This top is good quality and cute. it runs large- i'm usually a medium and needed a small. the reason i will be returning it is because it flares out at the bottom on the black which is very unflattering on. it makes me look wide in the waist or like i'm wearing a maternity top. unfortunate because i really liked everything else about it.
"I'm a pretty solid 10/12 in this brand. i went with the 12 since some thought the top to run small...and i agree. while i can wear it and think it will actually stretch out with wear, it's tight in the shoulders and chest. for the record, those are 2 areas i never have problems with. i'm a 36b and it was flattening my chest. it was also quite short on me. i have a short torso and it was barely hitting below my belly button. the shirt felt more like a size 8 than 12."
"I gave this four stars only because the lining has some polyester (poly/rayon blend) in it and i don't like polyester; still, i couldn't pass it up due to the chic look and the oh so warm feel of the coat. it's like wrapping yourself in a warm blanket and the wine color looks amazing! it's a little on the pricey side. since i consider it more of a sweater than a coat, i would have liked the price better if it was $100 less. it was one of those items that was hard to take off once i put it on. i"
"I like this sleeveless sweater - it adds warmth and visual interest without adding a lot of bulk. paired with black/white patterns it's pretty versatile (as seen in the pics) - a great staple for a more casual office environment. being a taller girl i love the length on it, and find it's flattering for my curvy figure."
"This blouse is super cute but oddly sized. i bought a size up and still i squeezed into the top around the bust. the front slit is too low and shows a bit too much cleavage, so this had to go back. i really tried because the fabric is wonderful and the shirt is light and breezy for summer, i just couldn't make it work
."
"I love the sweatshirt 
 clay color is very different it's a nice light fabric with nice detailed edges 
 although it is an oversized piece it hangs and fits well although i am petite
 great light sweatshirt for spring and summer"
"Love the patterns and the length.  i basically would agree with all the reviewers including the person who noted no pockets. 
it's really a special piece and on sale, very worth it!"
Very comfy and light. can be casual with jeans and boots or dress it up with a nice necklace and pencil skirt.
"I got the navy stripe version of this shirt and it has a very cute nautical vibe to it. i am either an xs or s in antho, and went with the xs for this shirt as i think the s would be too boxy. normally i would have overlooked this shirt as it's rather unimpressive on the hanger, but it was on sale so i tried it on. very cute when tried on! it fits well across the shoulders but isn't too clingy in the body, which i like. the fabric is very comfortable and the shoulder detail gives it a little mor"
"Not sure why this shirt is getting bad reviews. i am tall and have a long torso, so perhaps that is the issue for some who find it not so flattering? maybe if your taller it hangs better? i have to say... i love everything about it. it is a fantastic print, it is very flowy but i don't think it's too much in that regard. i think it is fitting with the romantic, girly style of the garment. in my opinion not too short, just right. i took a medium, i am 5'8"" and athletic."
"I love maeve and was so excited for this top which looked like an update from a last season favorite. unfortunately the fabric was stiff, it was tight in the chest and went straight down from there. returned."
All the rave reviews are true!  this vest is plush and funky and i love wearing it. i'm having fun figuring out different outfits to wear with this. this is a great three season layering piece and i'm thrilled i was able to get it on sale.  my only regret was the lack of a petite selection.
I love this top. i got it on sale and am so glad that i did. it is a short too but still super flattering. it isn't too boxy on me.
I tried this on the other day at the local store in a size xs/s. although it's wool i didn't notice that is was itchy & usually wool bothers me. i am of small build but i did like the long & oversized look. i admit i am drawn to the print anyways. i noticed the right armhole was larger than the left so i tried on another xs/s - it was the same. probably the armholes will be smaller in the petite sizes. i decided to make other purchases but will order the petite xs/s in a few wks since the invent
"This has great drape, length, the pattern is super versatile with solids or prints. i am finding the wool to be itchy around the neck, so not sure if i will keep, though i don't seem to want to take it off! has a lightweight, boiled wool texture, contrasting print and design so cool!"
"I was skeptical about this duster and had to see it in person, and it was love at first sight. the black and white makes it versatile, and the pattern makes it interesting and fashion forward. more importantly, the pattern is cleverly designed which doesn't compete with your wardrobe should you wear a bright color or a similar pattern (as shown on model). i purchased the regular xs/s and it fit me fine (i'm 5'2"", 34b, 26 waist, and 36 hips) and the hem falls about two inches below my knees. the"
"Surprisingly flattering on, especially with pants/jeans. extremely figure flattering because it enhances the figure and hides flaws: the pleating enhances the bust, the v-cut provides a touch of a peekaboo (not enough to show cleavage but it's there in a super flattering way), the hem flares out a bit to hide the tummy and enhance the bust even more; the short sleeves are versatile so it can be worn in the office, under a jacket, or just plain for going out. the material is not too thick but not"
"The top runs small, it is a very sexy and slimming top. i tried in l, it was too small so i have ordered it in xl. i hope it fits because it is very fitted and i am worried that the bottom will roll to the top with a fabric like this. but it is a very sexy, good looking, and slimming top. i love it!!"
"I was looking for a basic tee, but this one was just ok...the quality is okay, but it us not as soft as i would have liked. unfortunately,  i will be returning this item."
"An excellent going out to dinner, to a lounge, etc. piece. super flattering, sexy, feminine and trendy! can be dressed up or down with some nice accessories. i'm only 5 feet and very wary of jumpsuits, but this was excellent!"
I would've looked right over this online but i saw it in store and had to try on. the navy and the white were both cute but i tried the navy. i'm usually a m but went with the s b/c it looked better fitted. this shirt has a very vintage feel to it and is slinky and comfy. i can't wait to wear. would look great with white jeans!
This elegant white lace dress attracted compliments everywhere i wore it. it is classic with just the right amount of quirkiness . i like everything about it!
"I've been looking for the perfect work-appropriate lace dress (for a casual/creative work environment) for a while, and this was just the ticket! the pointed collar and demure shape add some structure to the feminine lace. i rolled the sleeves to a short-sleeve length just to tone done the cutesy factor a tiny bit more (although the sleeves, worn long, are absolutely gorgeous!). the lace isn't exactly the highest quality lace that retailer has ever used, but pretty nonetheless. i'm 5'5 /125 and th"
Disappointed in the quality of the dress. love the style and especially the colors. the fabric of the body of the dress is very very thin and just poorly made. the top bodice is more substantial. not worth the price tag of $148.00. dress does run short.
"Comfy cozy and a bit on the big size, even for an oversized piece. order a size down, even if you want a boxier look. unsure how the fabric will hold up-but if it does it will be a great get."
"This dress is not what i expected. the bottom half is wool-like material-looks like someone has worn it. the top snags easily so you must be careful when wearing jewelry. when i received the dress i noticed there were two small holes under the arms. i wouldn't of paid full price but for the amount, i sewed up the holes and packed it away for winter."
I ordered the sweater in a medium but it was too large - so reordered it in the small and it fits perfectly. love the length- it hits mid hip. it is more of an a-line than straight as show in the picture. the detail is fun and the sweater is well made. highly recommend it- i have received lots of compliments on this sweater.
"I love this top, it's design is very pretty and like nothing that i have. i think this top runs true to size, i'm usually an xs/s in tops and i went with the s for this one and it fits great. i will say that the top layer of material will snag very easily, so while wearing it you have to be very careful!!"
"This skirt is very short. i ordered my usual xs petite and it was so short that the longest part ended above my ankle. that's quite off because i'm only 5 feet tall, and i wore it pretty low on the hips. it also flares out awkwardly below the knee. there are 2 vertical seems and they exacerbate the jagged appearance of the hem. i was drawn to the edgy style shown in the photo but in person it looks like my 5 year old cut up a skirt. plus, the fabric--while thick and beautiful and stretchy--has a"
"This sweater is of nice quality and has such great detail to it - love the pattern to the knit and the ribbon detail is unique and beautiful. the knit itself is of mid to thicker weight, so definitely appropriate for winter, fall, and cooler spring days. i bought my normal size small and felt like it had more of a slub fit than pictured in the model shot - it was wider down the torso and a little shorter (not tunic length like picture). i'm 5'7"" with a longer torso and this hit maybe mid-bum and"
"I really like the appearance of this item, and it looks pleasing with many different styles of leggings. it does run a little large. i am a ""true to size"" small, and this hangs on me a little, but i love the design of the back. it is so soft and comfortable!"
"I don't normally review my purchases, but i was so amazed at how poorly this dress was made, i couldn't help myself but to post a review. the neck line isn't even hemmed down so it flaps up. the material is thin and feel cheap. this dress isnt even worth $20 in my opinion. i was expecting a well made, good quality dress for the high price tag."
"Ordered this dress online, and i love it! i was looking for an understated but fun new years dress and this was exactly what i was looking for. the only minor qualm i had about the dress was that the velvet dots that hit where the seams met made the dress look puffier than it should some parts around the waist, but for the most part, the dress fit very well and was very flattering, may just need a little bit of ironing. i am 5'9 and usually am more conscious of how things fit around my hips, and"
"I saw this online but it never struck me as something i would wear. however, after seeing it in the store it really caught my eye with its detailing, so i tried it on. what a great decision because it is so much more beautiful in person, and very soft and warm. it's a perfect winter sweater to start the new year. i am 5'-7"", 138 lbs. and the medium fit perfectly, though it's a little shorter on me than shown in the photos."
"If your hips are bigger than a size 6 us you can't fully close this robe. the model must be wearing the larger of the two sizes to have such a nice oversized fit. the fabric is soft and lux and amazing, but the weird dart in the back and the closure is right over my sadly size 8 hips and butt. if i was taller and thinner i would have kept this and worn it every day."
"Like the reviewers before me, this dress runs small in the rib cage. i normally take a 12 and am a 32b. the max size that this dress comes in is a 12 so i could only order a 12. it just fit but that is because i am a smaller 12 on the top. there is no wiggle room in the dress. 

that being said, it is a really cute style and shape - rather like a 50's style dress if you will with a sexy back. i am curvy on the bottom and this dress hides the flaws there for sure. however, because it is a fulle"
"I should have exchanged it for a smaller size, but i wanted to wear it, so my mistake. i tend to wear size 12-14, and the large is entirely too big. it also had piling right out of the bag. but it is just so soft that i tore the tag off and wore it anyway. if you get this, size down for sure."
"I'm surprised other reviewers loved this one so much. it's completely different then how it looks on the model. it's much shorter, which others do mention, but it flares a lot. enough to feel maternity-ish on me. it looks fitted on the model. maybe it's my shape, i have a short torso and carry weight in my hips. i ordered an xs too. i will say the material
is very nice and it's well made, but it's going back."
"This sweater is fine for the casual days. i bought this in cream and i have to say after one wash it looks old. i'm a huge retailer lover and buy a lot of clothes from them. this is just not the best quality and looks tired after a few wears. very soft, but poor material. not my favorite purchase."
"Great fit! no bagging and sagging and they fit true to size. very cute! for reference, i&#39;m 5&#39;2, 115 lbs and take a 26p. they look just like they do on the model. i highly recommend!"
"Just tried 'layered sadie top' and it felt so nice on. good hand feel for both materials but note that the knit on top is a little too delicate for machine wash but can be hand washed. this item is definitely ""vanity-sized"". i'm 5'1, 113lbs and the xs looked nothing like how it does on the model. it was flowy as depicted but it came down much lower on me and looked a little maternity-esque. highly recommend because it's gorgeous and well made but i would definitely come in and try it out for you"
"The length is perfect. the cut of the hemline makes it off the charts cute. i love it w ghillie type flats or booties. pair w a big warm sweater, or a sleek turtleneck, and watch heads turn as you enter the room! i promise! love this skirt."

"This dress is beautifully constructed. it is very fitted and does run on the small side. it will be a perfect derby dress. the lace is lovely and the pearl buttons are great touch. age appropriate for anyone..a very 
pretty dress. simple, classic and gorgeous!"
"I really wanted this dress to work out, but i was slightly disappointed in the fabric for the sleeves. the fit was accurate. i'm 5'7 and ordered a 6, however, my husband said it looked too little girl like. i did end up returning it :("
"I got this top to wear with shorts as the color goes with a lot of different prints. the quality is excellent. this top runs very large, as in three (3) sizes too large. for the record i am a 34.25.35 and ordered my regular size the xs and this top makes me like i'm pregnant with twins. also, the layering looks nothing like it does on the model, it looks sloppy, unkept and a general. i think this would still be great for ladies who are bigger in the chest and waist, otherwise it just doesn't wor"
"The color is a very soft peach, and the knit top over the gauze is a very light, summer-weight knit. i can see this being worn casual, or dressed up with a statement necklace and nice skirt / pants."
"I bought the dress that has the cream skirt with large flowers. i wore it for a wedding and was not only very comfortable with the pockets and the cotton top, i looked good. i got a lot of compliments on the outfit. people thought it was a shirt and blouse rather than a dress. i loved the high low skirt. the sizing was accurate and the dress is easy to clean."
"I got this dress in hopes of having a really nice winter formal dress. it was not well made at all! the lining didn't line up with the top layer and the waist puffed out in uneven places. i am curvy so a puffy waistline in the last thing i need! the fabric itself is very nice, but just not well made. i do not recommend this dress."
"Soft, comfortable, stylish. i eagerly awaited the arrival of this beautiful sweater and was not disappointed. the sizing was accurate for a perfect fit and i love the feminine detailing and shape of the necklne. the ribbons add an extra touch of style to a sweater that is both casual and elegant at the same time. very versatile."
"This is my first pair of mcguire jeans, and i like the fabric and fit.  thank goodness for petite sizing!  these 32p fit just right on my hips, with no gap between the waistband and my body.  fits through thigh and hips and pretty slim all the way down.  nice stretch.  of course, the proof will be after wearing a few times and washing.  i will update my review if i do not like them so much after that,"
"Adorable sweater with a loose knit that helps slim down my man-back appearance. cut is tapered to the body but with a soft flare at the bottom hem. not clingy, very soft fabric doesn't accentuate bulges so i am happy about it's forgiving silhouette."
"I walked into retailer with low hopes of finding a dress for a friend's spring wedding, as a lot of this season's dresses are more casual, but was drawn to this pretty number for multiple reasons: it can certainly be dressed up or down depending upon accessories, the fabric feels incredible, it has pockets, and it's really fun yet classy as heck. typically i wear a 10/m in dresses, but they only had a 12 in store, so i took it and made it work by tightening the sash a bit extra and wearing a bra w"
"I was able to snatch this dress up just before it sold out (and i see it's now back in stock!). the quality of the fabrics is outstanding, not flimsy at all. the top is stretchy. normally i would wear a 2 at retailer, but the only choice i had was 0 and it fit. i am 5'5"" tall, 125 lbs. everything about this dress makes me smile and i can't wait to wear it to my holiday party! don't hesitate if you are on the fence."
I saw this dress online and immediately went to the store to try on! it took three sales asscoaites to help me zip the dress but once it was on it was beautiful! the bodice fits really nicely. true to size. there was extra fabric around the waist bust nothing that made the fit look weird. love love love!!! wearing for christmas eve!
"I got he green color with gray accent stitching, looks awesome with gray tone leggings. super soft, definitely runs a little big (5'6"" 140 lbs i ordered the small) but not in an unflattering way."
"Love this tunic, it's super comfy & cute. i have in cream and love so much i ordered in mint. looks great with jeans and boots"
"I thought this dress was worth reviewing since my opinion differs from many others.
i agree that the fabric is quite thin compared to what you may be used to with byron lars dresses, but the flattering fit and quality (has a nice built in slip) i found to be what you may expect from the brand. if you go in thinking it's more of a spring/summer dress, you will not be disappointed.
however, i find the sizing to be slightly off. i usually wear a 2p (i'm 5'2""), or a 0 regular.
i ordered several size"
"I really love this lace-up shirt, but i only liked it in black on me. i like it open like the model is wearing it, but i had to have it a little more closed because the lace part does go down a ways-and i felt like i was revealing a little too much. i would likely wear it open, but then have to pair it with a cami underneath to feel comfortable. i absolutely love the whole outfit as-pictured, and also reviewed the polka dot pants. i wish the laces were a little longer than they are-if you have i"
"I love byron lars dresses, and this design is on-point. the ruffle at the neckline is so pretty, and the dress fits like a dream. however -- the fabric!!! i would have loved it if this dress had a heavier feel. this is, sadly, going back today."
"Love this blouse, it;s super comfy, looks awesome with jeans. this blouse runs true to size i purchased in my normal size small."
"I fell in love with this dress when i saw it online and due to the ""slim fit,"" i ordered a size up -- a 2 petite up from my normal 0 petite. when i received it, i was surprised about two things: 1) the material was kind of puffy (not bad, just weird), and 2) it was too big on top - rare for a petite size - even though it fit everywhere else. i wanted to love it, but had to return. would be gorgeous for someone else!"
"I was hesitant based on the reviews, but i'm glad i ordered this dress (in blue). the material is like a french dot texture that is soft but still a bit structured. i had no issues with the fit. it's appropriately just a little oversized. the styling is very mod!"
Great feature...perfect lacing...do not need to worry that it is too low since there is material behind the bottom of the lacing. like 3/4 length sleeve. gives top the right proportion.
"I purchased this jacket in green, x-small a while back and wasn?t 100% sure about it due to the size. i?m 5?3?, 117 lbs and a 33a and thought it was a little snug so i tried on the small and that was way too big so i kept the xs. i have worn it a few times and it does look great however i can only wear thin tops with it. recently i purchased the black, x-small and this i love. it?s looser then the green so i can get away with thicker tops. 
i do recommend both jackets. they are pricey for what"
"I love this dress, i mean it si really pretty in person, however, the breast area is just too small... i can't wear a bra with it, and my ""older"" breasts just droop, not flattering. they are barely covered... i am a bit disappointed at that, but if you are smaller up there, i say give it a try... i am 115 lbs, 26.5 ion waist, 30dd and xs petite was great everywhere but chest.

colors and fabric are great, i love that the different colors are different types of fabric... too bad."
"I love the lace up design and bought the red xsp, fabric is a bit thin and mediocre quality, but over all happy with purchase. wish this top came in navy and white as well. even a navy/white stripe would be a fun option too. thanks you for offering this top in a petite size. :)"

"I got this shirt in the mail today and was really excited to try it on. other reviewers said that it ran large so i ordered a size down and it fit perfect. i looked in the mirror and noticed the ruffles were misaligned and obviously so. i want to exchange it in the store but seeing that the size is not longer available online, i'm not really sure i'll find another one in my size."
"I love this jacket over a dress! it's snug fitting so can't wear anything bulky under it, but super stylish and comfy stretchy material. it's a bit pricey but i get a lot of wear out of it so worth it to me."
I'm 5'1 and 110 lbs.  i ordered this in a xsp and i could barely zip it up.  and when i did i couldn't breathe. i tried again and ordered a sp and it's perfect! now i just need somewhere to wear it.
"Beautiful shirt, hits me a little higher. i'm not sure i'm going to keep it just because i have something similar but its a beautiful top. i'm 5'6"" and carrying a little extra baby weight right now so i'm an 8-10 instead of my usual 6-8. i ordered an 8 and it fit well."
"I love this blouse because it's great for work with cardigan over it, and great for going out with skirt, pants or jeans. it is tts and very flattering, light weight, and comfortable."
"I happened upon this in my local store despite the fact that it is an online exclusive. i love finding returns so i can see them in person. i loved the soft colors right away. my hesitation was the standup collar but it actually folds down just fine and gives the vest lapels too. it also looks nice belted, left slightly open. i usually wear small or xs in tops and the small fits nicely. it doesn't need to close since there are no built-in fasteners. i will wear it with a long button down shirt o"
"I found this to fit tts. i sometimes wear petite, but found the petite sizing to be a little off. i have a pretty short torso, but found the petite to be too short. i opted for the regular sizing and got a 6; it fits great. this top is great for work (styled with a cardigan or blazer) or for play. i can see it dressing up or down very easily."
"I ordered the mustard yellow in 10 and found the shirt to fit true to size. it works great with a skirt and with jeans but i did need to wear it with high rise jeans otherwise it came right to the top of my normal jeans and i didn't want to risk showing any skin at work. 

the color is amazing and looks good with just about any color bottom so there is a lot of room to have fun with the top. 

being larger on top the ruffles did not bother me at all, but rather act like an accessory - i find"
"I just tried this top in red in xs and i think it's cute. it's fairly fitted in my opinion; the sleeves are pretty snug but there's stretch to them. i was fine with the fabric and the size xs (i'm ~105 lbs, 34aa) even though sometimes i fit better in xspetite. the only downside is that the washing instructions say to remove the tie before machine washing, and i guess that put me off a little (the idea of re-lacing it every time). so i haven't yet bought it. the red is vibrant, tomato red and the"
"The cut of this shirt is lovely and well thought out, the opening for the arm are not too big like some other shirts. i liked the material and the melon/ salmon color which i ordered was more vibrant in person. this does run large so i wished i had ordered one size down."
"5'6"" 113lbs purchased size small in rich navy. so soft and comfy and i like that the cuffs help the pants not ride (even during sleep). i like that the fit is slim but not constricting on legs as all my yoga pants. tested this at my local vinyasa class and it held up without making me too hot (and i sweat a lot).

my biggest complaint is that the fabric pills right out of the packaging. actually their tag says the fabric does this and over time will continue to do this more and more because of i"
Great looking jacket with attitude. the color is more like a faded black or deep charcoal grey. i'm usually a large petite but this is snug in the chest. luckily it's a knit so i can make it work by zipping it partway and leaving the top half open.
"These jeans are so cute! they are perfect for petites too! i am fit, look way younger than my age and get so many compliments when i wear these jeans. i'm. i'm 5'2"", 115 libs and they definitely fit tight in a good way. just like the photo pretty much. they are not small like the white mother ankle fray jeans for sale on the site now. those definitely run smaller so these are true to size with a tight fit."
I live in los angeles and this is the perfect beginning of fall jacket! i've worn it with dresses and with jeans. definitely has enough extra room to slip a hoodie or small seater on underneath when it gets colder. it's soft and stylish. the only downside is that the pockets aren't really deep enough to put anything in.
"I loved this dress as soon as i tried it on, but... it bunched up weird in the front around my hips. i ordered a second size 4, hoping that it would fit better. but same thing. if i tried to go to a size 6 it would be too big every where else. fyi - i'm 5'8"" 129lbs and i'm a runner. it's not like i have a huge backside or anything. my guess is sizing is off. i've tried another of his dresses and it fit perfectly."
I really like this top. it's super cute - perfect for a football game or fairly casual event. the material is ribbed and is thick enough that you can't see through. i purchased this top in red and initially in petite but ended up returning it for the regular size. i love this top!
"Nice tee, true red,3/4 sleeves, lacing is a nice touch. good quality and great sale price."
Feminine and lovely flutters indeed. i am on the fence. i ordered in a petite - had to size down - and something about bust and arm holes not completely right. given the light and airiness of this tank it does not seem right to have to wear a camisole underneath which is what it would need for work wear.
"Very nice casual, inexpensive shirt and the laced neckline is great....not too revealing and easily worn tied 
without looking prudish. and of course, open as well"
"When i ordered this little jacket i knew i would like it, upon arrival i fell in love. it is a little edgy with leather detailing and with stretch in all the right places, the crop is super flattering. appeared online to be a bit more of a sweatshirt material but it has so much structure and holds its shape!"
"I'm usually an xs for most retailer dresses and shirts. i ordered up per other reviews and got a small. the small fits comfortably around my waist. the chest area is not made for large chests. my 34ds were barely contained. sad to say, i won't be keeping the dress. the layers, fabric, and colors are truly pretty but the design/fit is disappointing."
"I really like how this looks on the model, but in real life this top is much tighter. i was hoping for a good layering top and have been playing around with the trend of lace up tops. i bought it without trying on figuring a small would work, but it was much too tight and the lace top reminded me of vans shoes. i returned it, a girl much tinier than myself has it and it is very cute on her. so, best works on a model body type figure than someone with even slight hips."
I got this shirt in red and black. both colors vibrant and material of shirt is nice cotton blend. will get lots of use from both shirts.
This is the most flattering shirt--love the fit and color!
"Three strikes and retailer is out for me! i am so disappointed. i really liked this dress and was looking for a fun, distinctive new shift dress. got it, tried it on, took it off, went back to look at the listing online...nowhere does it mention that it has a drop-seam in the shoulders. i guess you can see it if you zoom in closely on the image, but it's not mentioned in the text. who on god's green earth actually looks good with a drop-shoulder?! it hits every woman under 5'10"" right in the middl"
"This vest is very warm and soft. it is actually a fleece that almost appears as wool. the plaid is beautiful-a pretty soft pink with the black and charcoal colors. i ordered a size large and the fit is okay. an xl would have been too big under the arms and in the bust area however, i would have liked it a little looser in the bottom half. i kept the large as there is no closure to the vest. it just hangs open."
"I love this shirt so much that i've now bought it in 2 colors -- the olive green and the red. probably would have bought it in black too if i didn't already have enough black shirts. it's both a plain and simple tee, but with the fun lace-up detail at the neckline that keeps it from being boring.

it runs true to size but is very fitted. however, due to the thickness of the material, i didn't feel like any unflattering bumps or lumps were being highlighted, despite how close the shirt fit to my"
"Don't try this on, if you don't plan to buy it. it feels amazing!!! i bought the black and it is a lovely charcoal color and matches so much."
"I like the lace-up trend, but most designs are too revealing. this shirt is super sexy, but not immodest. i bought it in black and am now buying another color. to me, the fabric feels soft and thick, very nice."

I have these pants in navy and they're amazing! i cuff the hem in half and they look like joggers. they're ridiculously comfortable and tts but are not very thick so i'm pretty sure ivory would be see through; especially if you wear them during practice.
"I got this top in navy and i love it. it's loose and flowy and comfortable, yet dressy enough to wear for work (or dress down with jeans). i'm 5'4"", 125lbs and the 6 was a bit large on me. i could've sized down a little but i actually liked the loose fit, and the length was long enough to tuck in if i wanted to. definitely recommend."
"I purchased the navy in this top and i really like the design and the style for the price (i believe the navy is on sale). my issue is that i do have to wear either a camisole or a little bralette or bandeau or something under it because it is too low cut in the front on me and the arm holes are ridiculously large. i might have been better off sizing down, but i bought it online, so i just decided to live with it. pretty top, though i do think it runs large."
"Great shirt. the neckline is super flattering. the fabric has some weight to it. right now i am in a ""fat stage""...and it still looked good. it will look even better without the midriff bulge! i bought the shirt in black. i'm thinking of ordering it in red...it's that good."
"This is a great shirt that goes with everything. it's super sexy and i have to say....the girls look great in it! i bought the black first and went back for the green. the quality of the shirt is great...not cheap and no smell, at least not in my experience,  like was mentioned by another reviewer. i can't say enough about how cute this shirt is!"
"I purchased this blouse because i love a 70's vibe in my tops. it is a beautiful, colorful top, but the colors weren't flattering on me. having said that, the cut is nice, the fabric is lightweight and flows nicely, and the fit was fine on me. i am a curvy 5'5"" with a 36 c cup. go for it if this is a style you like. one other note, i wish it had been a bit longer, but i am older and prefer a little more coverage. it's just a personal preference. i think the picture is an accurate depiction."
It's hard enough for women to find clothing that will make them look as beautiful as they feel but add a bigger bust size (i'm a 36dd) and it makes it this much harder. i ordered this top because of how beautiful it looked on the model and the price. when it arrived i was so excited! retailer does such a beautiful job with the way they handle their items! it was wrapped beautiful and no damage. i ordered a size 8 knowing that my chest could be a potential problem. the too itself is gorgeous! i did
"Ordered this in white. it is really nice and sexy but very body hugging and unforgiving. perhaps it is my large stomach, but it hugs a bit too much for my liking. yet i think overall the design is very nice so i am keeping it and hoping i can lose some weight in my tum."
"This is one of those you have to try it on to appreciate the lovely unique design. it is a very unique, flowing, romantic piece. it is sheer and i would wear a nude camisole underneath. i am normally a size small and bought a size 2 (i tried on a 6 in the store just to see what it looked like, fell in love with the look and the retailer associate recommended i buy a size 2). love it!"
"I got to try this on today and i really like it. the fabric is a normal t-shirt kind of fabric (i was hoping it would have been kind of special) and the v-neck in the front does go down a ways so that some cleavage is showing. i would feel comfortable wearing it as-is outside of work, but would have to pair it with a cami if i would going to wear it to work. normally, i am not a huge fan of v-neck in the back and it drives me crazy thanks cami's these days are often made with a ""versatile"" v and"
"A breath of fresh air. spring flowers! easy to wear. very feminine and flattering. looks great with denim, orange, reds , etc. very happy with this purchase."
"Nice fit and flare style, not clingy at all. i got the grey color, petite large, fits perfect. will wear with tights/boots or booties. lots of color options to accessorize with."
"This top is soo pretty with a cool edge.
it looks and feels like really good quality."
"This dress is flattering in all the right places. it has a gorgeous skirt with a comfortable, form-fitting top. it provides just the right amount of coverage. i love it so much i bought it in two colors!"
"When i first opened this dress and tried it on i thought it was adorable. it is very flattering on my hourglass figure and hides my recent baby weight. the problem is the hem. it was already rolling up when i took it out of the package, and i should have noticed and returned it, but i figured the problem would be easily solved by a good ironing. well, it wasn't, and it gets worse every time i wash the dress. it's like the hem isn't constructed properly."
"I simply love this jacket. it's comfortable, soft and has a relaxed fit that is easy to wear. i wish i had bought mine while it was on sale."
I love this top! it's easily both day and night-worthy with a splash of sexiness in a front peek-a-boo design. lovely embossed design all over.
This bra is extremely comfortable and surprisingly supportive considering the lack of padding or firm material. it also runs large.
"I love this sweater dress and get compliments every time i wear it.. i bought the navy in size xs. the pattern and colors are just fun and youthful, although you don't have to be young to look good in this dress. the dress is fitted, but the skirt flares, making it flattering if you have hips like me. the material is not too heavy so you can wear this 3 seasons fall, winter, spring. as other reviews have mentioned the dress is short. i am 5'9"" so it does hit well above my knees. this isn't an is"
"I bought this in the white, size m (140lbs., 5'8"", 34b) because i wanted a baggy fit, which i got, so this is tts. the white is more of an off-white rather than a bright white, which i like because i happen to be looking for an off-white tee. and the shape is good--even in a larger size, this tee nips in at the waist.however, the quality of this tee is lacking, as it is the typical, cheap, marled, slightly see-through material that seems to be everywhere these days and the band on the back of th"
Extremely flattering. an easy dress to wear - good choice for both day and evening
"I took a chance and tried on this jacket today at the store. at first i was worried that it might look boxy on me but as soon as i put it on, it was love at first sight! it's so cute and very comfy! the sleeves are slightly long on me but that's been a recurrent issue regarding all my jackets. i'm only 5'3"" about 124 lbs. and it fit me very well. because it's a bit cropped, it makes me look taller. glad the weather is starting to warm up so i can find more excuses to wear it. i didn't need anoth"
"Bought this in an xs and i liked the style of the skirt. it was long enough to wear to work. 
however the waist was too large and would not stay up on my waist. returned."
"I ordered this top in the solid navy. the quality seemed very good, and my overall impression was favorable. what i liked was that the top stayed off the shoulders even when i was moving. so many of the on-trend ""cold shoulder"" tops simply do not stay put with even the slightest movement. unfortunately, this top ran quite a bit large. if you are in between sizes - i definitely recommend sizing down. i've not seen the printed floral option, but the dark navy is lovely and looks chic with white bo"
"Nice fabric, very versatile but the knit top and style accentuates your bust. probably not an issue for most but if your a d or up it's more attention than you may want."
"I tried on the usual xs in the patterned style, and it fit really nicely. the colors are very nice in person, vibrant. teh cut is flatering and gives a nice definition at the waist i also love the lace up neck detailing. the sleeves flutter out, and will give a bit more volume, if i would change something that would be it. i would make the sleeves more fitter or perhaps shirter with the flutter. i am 115 lbs for reference..."
"I had it on my wish list for a long time, not sure whether i should purchase, i even hesitated when it went on sale, but boy, am i glad i did order it... it is crazy comfortable, flattering, and love that it looks black but is blue... i ordered both xs and xs p and decided to go with the petite as it will look super cute in the fall with boots. not too short (i am 5 foot 1.5)... the fake leather part concerned me at first, but i like it now... nothing bad ot say about it!"
I tried this on in store and since my usual size 6 wasn't available i tried on a 4. it was a little snug in the upper sleeves and shoulders but was lovely otherwise. i passed on it and waited for it to go on sale to order it online. i got it in my usual size 6 but it seemed to me like it was 2 sizes bigger than the 4. i have decided to keep it but i just wasn't thrilled with the fit.
"I agree that this blouse is boxy, but because it's not too long in length it evens it out. any longer or shorter would make it look too boxy. it's great for work to dinner during the week & goes great with jeans too."
"Soft cotton in very stylish yet simple style. regrettably, i listened to reviews that said it ran tts and ended up w a baggy long one that won't work even if i shrink it. that will teach me-- always order multiple sizes!"
"I ordered this dress in size xl in the grey/red/yellow combination. i love everything about this dress. it's comfortable. the colors are cheerful. the proportions of where the stripes are placed works. but, i have to return this dress. it's too short for what i'm comfortable wearing. i saw from the photos that this comes mid-thigh on the taller models. i hoped that would mean it would be more knee-length for me. unfortunately, it's just too short and i'd feel self-conscious. i don't want to deal"
I had to order this blouse since it is named after the town i live in. it does not disappoint. the flowers are so pretty and it has great style. there is a little piece in the neckline so it is not too revealing. the sleeves are loose and cover the bra strap underneath. the back has a little bit of elastic so it does not look like a maternity shirt and it gives you some shape. i can't wait for it to warm up and to wear this!
Perfect trans top.  skinnies or boyfriend and booties.  love the mixed prints
"This top reminds me of the special tops i got ""once upon a time""...when retailer adopted a more curatorial approach to their store. this is a beautifully-made top...quite dramatic but comfortable. i've received many compliments each time i've worn it. it has wonderful drapery and movement."
This blouse is so pretty and well made. it will be a new favorite with dark jeans and boots. it is very boho and a lovely blouse to feel dressed up a bit on a jeans day. loose in a flattering way (it does not look like a maternity top). very happy!
"I love the layered look of this jacket. i got it in navy which matches everything. i think it's a little on the large side for me. i ordered a small. i'm 5'2"" 130 lbs. super comfortable. the inner layer is very soft. once you wash it, the outside is soft too. i've already worn mine several times. happy."
"I really wanted to love this dress, but it was so short! i'm only 5'6"" so i don't consider myself really tall, but the dress only came a couple of inches lower than my butt! way too short for me. my husband asked if it was a shirt or dress haha. but i think this would look adorable on someone a few inches shorter. or someone younger who can pull of a short shirt :)"

"I ordered size small and medium because i can go either way depending on brands. and both look great! there is no significant difference except medium fell about 1 inch longer. i am 5'4"" and size small hem fell about 1"" above knee. size medium felt tab bit more loose but i thought fabric may stretch a bit after wear so i'm keeping size small. what a beautiful dress! although the body of dress is jersey material, it is lined so there is good coverage. i tend to not like ""faux leather"" since they"
"...there's enough room for a small family to live under the chest and trunk area of the blouse! sorry-had to say that! all kidding aside-since it's been thirty plus years ago since we were wearing these, many of us have forgotten what peasant blouses truly fit like. this is no exception- it is very billowy, flouncy, and roomy-more so even than today's peasant styles, i think. it is lovely and quite fitted across the chest -so that's how i ordered my size and it worked. i think if one sizes down"
"This top is so pretty and feminine. the different floral patterns work very well together and add an interesting flare to this unique blouse. the fit is very comfortable yet still very flattering due to the empire waist and flared sleeves. the fit is true to size, i usually wear a size medium or 10 in retailer tops and the size 10 fit quite nicely. this top is a great addition to any spring wardrobe and should transition nicely into summer as well."
"Very cute, very comfortable. for me aesthetics and comfort must go hand in hand. this dress fits the bill."
Cropped and wide- would look cuter on someone who is more petite. was too wide and cropped for me. very sheer.
The fun colors drew me to this but it sure fit weird. the top was fine but it became a bit tent-like in the waist. the material doesn't feel great either.
"I really like the style of this top, and it's delicate but well made, but i wish it were longer and less boxy. it's nice that it comes with a separate cami to layer, but the cami is very cropped. when i raise my arms you can see a lot of midriff (and the top is see through so a layer underneath is necessary). a longer cami probably wouldn't work because the top is also very short. i'm 5'0'' with an average torso length, and ordered the xxs petite. also, you would have to cut the tag off if you d"
"This is a pretty top that is conservative enough for the office, with a modest neckline. there is a little hidden snap or button under the bow at the neck so you don't have to keep fussing with the tie the fit is loose in the waist and high at the neck, so the sheer parts are the only thing to give it a little flirtiness. there is a matching camisole underneath that snaps in at the shoulders. overall, i thought it was nice when i tried it at the store, but it didn't have enough extra ""wow"" to ge"
Very comfortable and versatile. got lots of compliments.
"Is not a place i want to be, even if the style of a sweater is great.  yes, this sweater is very cropped, but i think it&amp;#39;s definitely intended to be worn off the shoulder to drop the waist a bit.  it&amp;#39;s the itchiness that makes it an immediate &amp;quot;no&amp;quot;, and that&amp;#39;s coming from someone who has serious fiber itch tolerance."
"The combination of vintage and bohemian styles seems as if it would be flattering on all figure types. and i love the combination of smaller and larger prints. the only thing i didn't like is that on the blouse i received, placement of the larger print on the bodice is asymmetrical (unlike the photo). it might not bother some customers, but it wasn't what i was expecting, so i ordered a new one. i may keep it even if the second one is off, because other than that small thing, i think the top wou"
Love the fabric & lace on this top. like other reviews said the arm area is tight where the lace meets the fabric which makes the fit uncomfortable. sadly this top is going back. if you have very skinny upper arms this top will fit fine.
"This dress is really cute in person. however, it did not fit me like it does the model in the pic at all. first of all i'm 5 feet 1 and it was wayyy too short on me. i didn't have the petit on either-- i had the regular xs. it just hits a couple of inches too short for me. i am 50. it would be adorable if i were more comfortable in shorter dresses. i wear short things a lot, but this was just too high on me. it was probably a good 8 inches above my knee. also it flared too dramatically at the wa"
"Saw this online and had to try it on when i found it in the store. i usually wear an 8 or a 10 depending on how things run, (i'm a 34 dd), so i tried on both sizes. i really could not see much of a difference between the two and was torn as to which size to get. the 10 was just a tad looser so i went with that one, but seriously i could not find or feel much of a difference. it is a very figure flattering top, and a plus that you can machine wash it. simply awesome!"
"This knit dress is very comfortable. i liked the various colors used in the stripes. my only issue with it, is that the skirt of the dress flares out oddly and is quite short. in my opinion, this dress, with its sturdy fabric and long sleeves, would appear more proportional with a longer skirt. skirt length, along with horizontal stripes just did not work for me. regrettably, i sent it back."
Love love this dress. fits so great. i normally wouldn't have picked this dress. more preppy than my normal style. fits amazing. my hubby has complimented me more on this dress than anything else i've ever owned. the fit & flare style is super flattering i felt it fit tts.
"This is one of my absolute favorites! the design is perfect, and the fabric is so beautiful. i don't love the coral color, but the mixed pattern is amazing. it runs a little large. i sized down one size and it fit perfectly. it's very flowy and comfortable. it's these unique, special designs that end of being my favorite retailer purchases. i've gotten so many compliments. very highly recommend!"
"I'm assuming the model showing the sweater is at least 5'9"", it is slightly cropped on her , but it certainly doesn't look super cropped. i'm 5'4"" and its super cropped on me. even with high waist jeans.
also, it is incredibly itchy. i even tried it with a cami under but the itchy wool came right through the cami.
too bad, its a cute design, just needs some tweaking."
"Beautiful colors, especially the pink. i am 5'3"" and about 124 lb. i got the small petite but am thinking of exchanging it for the regular xs. not only is it short hem-wise, which i don't really mind, but it is short in the waist. very pretty and good fabric."
"I love the style of this top. i just wish there were a slimmer version of it. unfortunately, this top doesn't suit my long, slim midsection. it is so wide, it completely hides the waist. i think it would look adorable on a different body type."
This dress caught my eye because i don't have anything like it. i wear between a m & l and preferred the large in this dress because i have a large bust. i usually wear a 10 in slacks and 12 in tops. i love the lace on this dress because it looks very delicate in the picture but it is very heavy and well sewn onto the fabric. it is durable while still looking elegant. i also like that it is in navy and not black. it is also nicely lined. i plan on wearing a colorful scarf with this dress.
A beautiful combination of eyelet with a soft fabric which lays beautifully. this does not make you look bigger then you are and i kept tts so the eyelet did not pull. mine fits perfectly. i personally will wear a cami under it as it is a bit sheer for me. it has an almost peacock print to it in colors of brown and tan. the black buttons down the back adds interest and charm. just adore it!
This dress looks great on me. it gives a slender appearance which hides a lot and it's easy and comfortable to wear.
"Overall, gorgeous blouse; very flattering. i love the sleeves; very unique and also flattering. i love how the blouse is a fit-and-flare from the bust. it's fitted at the bust (but not tight) and drapes with an a-line style. the fit of this blouse is truly flattering to the figure. no issues with inappropriate amounts of cleavage showing or anything. the ties are weighted on the end with metal tubes, which i really like because it makes the strings drape nicely. the back drapes beautifully. i fe"
Color is not like photo and fit doesn't work if you're busty

I first saw this jacket hanging at the store and it didn't look very cute. i saw it again on sale so i decided to try it on. i'm so glad i did! the inside gray material is so soft. i have broad shoulders and this jacket did not hinder my arms at all. it is very comfortable. i bought the x-small and was very surprised at how roomy it was. the sleeves are a tad bit long but the gray inner lining has an elastic cuff so it can be pushed up. not sure if the xx-small would've been too small or if the
"Good quality material. i got size 10 which is a little too big - size 8 would probably be better. very pretty, feminine top. a little too full in the waist/skirt area."
"For me, the tag sale is an opportunity to take a second look at items that i may have overlooked earlier, to pick up something fun at a good price. i found this dress in two colors in my size in the store! i took my usual xxsp at 32-24.5-32. length is perfect - just above the knee and the top is flattering with not too much fabric in the skirt. overall, this is a really cute staple dress. looking forward to wearing it in the spring. larger busted ladies size up. it is meant to be fitted in the t"

I absolutely love everything about this dress. it can be dressed up or down. no complaints.
The horizontal lines on the skirt and top gives the wearer and very nice dress. i am short so i got the 6 petite and it fits perfectly. the fabric is thick and stretchy.
This is a great top to pair with jeans to step a casual night up a notch.

"Slouchy relaxed fit. well sewn together and hangs well on the body. bottom hem hits upper thigh. good length and soft, easy fabric. light layering option as well. good spring jacket, can be kept on indoors without getting too hot."
"The colors are more vibrant than the photo indicates. indeed, though, the dress is very short and does pair well with leggings and boots.

i like that the dress highlights my hour glass figure, but with a generous nod to my curves with the accommodating skater skirt.

love it! will be easy to wear casually and work appropriate, too. the sale price was a huge bonus."
Top of the line! very well made and on sale to boot. i love the style and received a compliment from my sister when i wore it. i love the layered look.
"Perfect little summer tunic that is very flattering. paired with a skirt, jeans or cropped black pants- this top is perfect! the cut in the front is not overly deep- so a cami is not necessary. i am usually a l or xl or 12 in retailer tops and i have a 10 in this top. so it is sized slightly larger than usual."
This shirt is really pretty but the sleeves are so small. i normally wear between a 4 to a 6 or a size medium and i could not get this shirt on. i wish it fit but a size large would have been way to long and loose.
"I love this dress because its very playful and bouncy. it puts me in a light hearted mood when i wear it. i originally wanted to buy the grey color but my store only had the navy, so i tried it on. the navy is brighter and more colorful than it looks on line and the stripes are more varied in color than in the picture - so its quite appealing and vibrant. the lines of the dress are also quite flattering. all in all, its a fun dress!"
This blouse fit better than i expected. looks great with jeans and is an easy go to top!
"This dress is so comfortable, and i love the unique faux leather skirt and lace design. it really adds a special touch to the dress. i only gave it four stars because the top half is pretty boring...i wish the neckline wasn't so matronly. i'll definitely need a bib necklace or scarf to dress it up. i'm 5'5"" and 115 and ordered the xs. i wish the dress cut in a little more at the sides to accentuate an hourglass figure, also. my husband loved it."

I love this top! not sure if i would picked it up in the store; i received it as a gift from my husband. kudos to him as it was a great choice. i love that the sheerness and lace make me feel a little sexy but the long sleeves and camisole offer the modesty i tend to crave. really beautiful and can be worn either with jeans or a dressier skinny pant for a night out. hd in paris never fails to please with their aesthetic and quality.
This top is great for spring- it's super light and can be dressed up or down depending on what you're wearing it for. fits true to size and is great quality.
"I've admired the various iterations of this dress and finally found one in the sale room, much to my delight! i'm generally a sale shopper, so this doesn't mean i didn't think it was priced well. i have the oatmeal top with yellow/gold/orange pattern on the skirt in xs. the small fits comfortably up top, but on my petite frame, the top just looked too big, so i went with xs. i suppose the straps are a bit confusing, but their easy to figure out if you just look at them for a moment before puttin"
"This dress is comfortable as well as flattering, which does not happen very often!
looks good with navy tights too!"
Love love love this jacket!! great spring and fall weather.. very stylish!!

"Based on some reviews i decided to get the regular xs, even tho i am an xs petite (5'2, 107 lb, 32c) i found the fit to be flattering -- fitted enough but not too loose or tight. the length is perfect and work appropriate, and the material has some weight to it. the grey one is colorful and cute. the only problem is the bagginess of the arms -- very unflattering. if i push the sleeves up, it hides the bagginess a little, but i would like to have the option to wear the dress with long sleeves., s"
I purchased this dress because i have a similar one with a linen skirt from the spring. the skirt on this dress is a heavier fabric and it lays very nicely. the top provides good coverage for my larger chest and i took my typical xs size. i would definitely recommend this purchase.
"This jacket looked so good and felt so comfortable on- i almost didn't send back the first one that arrived with a little bit of damage at the bottom of the inner zippered sweatshirt, but i did exchange it and am just as happy with the fit and feel of the second one. it hangs well no matter how you fasten the front, or leave it open. great looking, casual but stylish and neat. a good grey, and a good blue."
"I went to my local store and they only had the blue dress in stock, i had seen it online and i didn't expect to like the blue one. i tried it on anyway, and it was adorable! i struggled to choose, but i ordered the gray one at the store and they shipped it directly to me. it arrived quickly and i love it!"
"This jacket has a nautical look which is a refreshing change for this year. it is double breasted & a stretchy cotton, which i love. i am a big fan of cotton. it appealed to me so much that i ordered both the white & the navy in the regular size small. i am of small build at 5'3"", 117# & expected that the sleeves c/b a little long. i avoid ordering petite size jackets b/c sometimes they are snug in the shoulders. ok, so the regular s was a good length at the bottom of my hips, but arms were bagg"
"Absolutely love this blouse but if your a woman cursed with larger arms for your body size than this is not for you. i couldn't get the lace part of the upper arms past my elbows.

oh well, it's going back!"
This top is gorgeous and versatile. i wear it with jeans and dress it up with a skirt. so happy to have this in my wardrobe.
"I thought that it looked like it belonged on a 15 year-old. i can almost see why they styled the model in what looks like ankle socks....ready for cheerleading. for reference it fits true to size, but is very short. i am 5'2"" and tried on a regular small - it was at least 5 inches above my knee."
"I loved this dress when i saw it. however the fit was way off. i am 5'7"" 120 lbs and the small was way too big from the waist down. when the xs arrived i was sure it would be perfect. unfortunately the waist hit way too high, above my rib cage and the dress was too short. it was as if it was a petite size. i was very disappointed as this is such a pretty, easy dress to just throw on for school. unfortunately neither size looked right on me and i had to return both. the material is also not the s"
"The jacket is great, the quality is very good and the fit too, the best part is how it looks !"
"So pretty, but does run large. i am an 8-10 , got the 8 and big through the chest. had to return for this reason. if you are on the busty side it will look fab on you."

"I was looking for a stylish spring/fall jacket and this one seemed to fit the bill. i was shocked by the quality and softness of the material and construction of this jacket. i could honestly not believe how comfortable and cute this felt and looked on me. i can't wear it enough! i am a short 5'2"" but 36d and have 31"" waist so i ordered a size m and l to see which would work best. as it turned out the m fit with plenty of room! i am normally a 12/14 so i was surprised by this. if you are on the"
"Love the detail and the way it hangs. i sometimes struggle with blousy tops because i have a larger chest, but this one didn't make me look pregnant! i purchased this with the 30% off... i wouldn't have paid full price for it."
I really wanted this to work. for me the arm cutout was too wide. a cap or lace flutter sleeve would've worked . also expected a little more length felt like the petite length.
"I just received these pants and i am very pleased.  they are a little longer than i expected them to be, but that actually works out well because now i can wear them to the office."
"Cute and pretty, runs a little wide and short, just slightly. i feel like i have that issue with all retailer clothes though. love the back."
"I was hoping this would go on sale and now it finally has! i loved this dress just as much in person as i have online. the fabric is interesting-it looks almost plastic in the online pictures but don't be fooled, it is still a comfortable fabric. it is almost like lots of diamond pieces were actually sewn together to make this dress and i love it. there is a sipper down the side to make it easier to get into, but also in the back there is bunched up fabric which is made to be ore bendable for th"
"I tried this dress on and felt amazing in it.  i got home and showed my husband my purchases.  i told him i wasn't sure if i should have bought this one and told him to be honest with me.  he said it looked great and he was glad i bought it.  so great for a spring wedding. fits true to size.  i am 125 5'4"" c-cup and i bought my normal size 0.  this made my waist look really small."

"Wow the mixed reviews on this dress would make someone not get it at all.
it is true to size. i'm a 6 and the six fit as a glove on me.
the material is not at all stiff. i actually wished it was a bit more structured. but that didn't bother me.
i was able to close the zipper by myself.
i'm 5'7"" 144lb 36a.
the top feels confortable to me as well. i don't considered myself curve like jlo but i have hips. the dress does not make me feel bigger at all.
the only down side is that it looks more expens"
"This is a very nice jumpsuit; reviewers were correct stating that torso is long & fit better a taller person. as soon as i read the reviews i went on and placed an order for size 8, i'm 6ft tall 160lb and it has been very difficult to find a jumpsuit to fit my long torso. this one however turned out to be perfect! true to size and fit, not only that, the fabric is very soft and good quality, very interesting style of the jumpsuit, looks much better in person! i particularly liked cropped, wide-l"
"This top runs super small in the upper arms, shoulder area..could not even stretch out my arms! ...other then that major problem, the length and body fit were perfect...i am true med and/or large in all retailer tops so i tried sizes 10, 12 and neither worked for me due to arm/shoulder fit...disappointed because it really is a beautiful top..."
"A nice alternative to jeans, good fit. i like the casual but edgy rocker look they have. will look good with booties and full length boots. i took the same size that i do in all pilcro pants."
"I love , love this top !! it looks just like the picture on model. the front is a soft t-shirt and the back is so cute and flattering . super unique and comfortable style.!! i am 5'4 -105 and xs fits perfect."
"This is a very cute and unique top!! i absolutely love the back, which makes up for my indifference of the front. i'm a little heavier in the middle, so it hides it a bit, but the light blue from the back that shows on the sides makes me feel a little wider. it's not perfect, but i like it enough to keep it. i got lots of compliments on it when i wore it. it's very comfortable too. i just wish the front had a little more to it or was a tad longer. overall very happy."
"This top is so lovely, i was worried of the color on my pale skin, but it is complementary, nice warm tones. yes, it is a tank, but i can see this as a transition piece into fall with a nice blazer, jeans, boots... the xs regular is perfect for me, length is adequate. if i were to go with petite, i might think it is too short. it is flowy, but still has shape, more than a swing top, so very flattering. the back is really cute too, definitely need a strapless for me, due to the thin straps..."
"Great pants, like the edginess of the design in the material. kinda rocker like. soft material that's stretchy and hopefully will hold its shape during the day. the color is listed as black but it's more of a dark gray with a slight blue hint."

"I love these! they are a perfect addition to my fall wardrobe, and just like all other pilcro jeans, they are a great fit and true to size."
"I often have a hard time finding items that fit true to size, but this top fits perfectly. it is cut really well and very flattering."

"I'm surprised i'm the first to review this dress! it is a must for the holidays and any special occasion! it is absolutely gorgeous! it is so feminine and seductive; it's one of those dresses that would be stunning on anyone! it is a quality dress, beautifully made, looks just like the photo. i'm 5'9"" & the hemline falls at the top of my knees. the neckline is exquisite & really ""makes"" the dress. i purchased the black version but if i was younger i'd get it in red as it would garner quite a bit"
"This shirt is very nice quality and looks stunning. it does run tight in the shoulder area and is a bit of a challenge getting off, but as long as i don't rip it one of these times all will be well! it looks so nice on that i overlook that design flaw."
The material is very soft and it looks just like it does on the model with the exception that it gets a little wrinkly at the hem and turns up at the corners. i like it and have already worn it a few times.
"Was drawn to this dress in the store. my location had it displayed well (one mannequin with the dress & a jean jacket...another with the faux fur cardigan). the dress is a very vibrant red. but the fit is not for me. i am busty (34c) with a short torso, and the dress made me look like dolly pardon on top. but there was a lot of room on the bottom. i tried on a size 6 and felt like i needed a size larger on the top and a size smaller on the bottom. having said that, the material is a very good qu"
"I was really excited about this top since i have others from retailer that are similar in styling. unfortunately, it just didn't work out. i am petite with a short torso and ordered my usual size and it was way too short in the front. the top was also boxy and didn't sit right. it just wasn't flattering. cute top on the hanger, but just not on me."

"The back of this t-shirt looks cute but the front looks really weird. the material in the back is quite stiff but the grey material is soft, so the front gray area ends up hanging weirdly and looking uneven and messy. i appreciate asymmetrical clothing but to me it looked like a patched up rag from the front. it fits true to size."
"Well, this top just did not do anything for me - it's a very conservative style with the high neckline and blousy fit. you'd need to go a little lower in size if you want any of your figure to show through. i guess it might be good for a church function or some other conservative event, but it was too buttoned-up for my style. i also had a hard time getting it off even though the size i tried on was large for me. i didn't care for the feel of the fabric either, although the lace is nice."
Well made. made my hips looks giant. just not my style unfortunately. i'd have to work at preschool or on a ship to pull this off. i'm 5'3 120-123lbssize 6-8. i got the size 6 (not petite cuz they were sold out).
"I love the color and the style, however it doesn't look as well as the model as i don't have a small waist like the model does. still overall, i love this dress and it is well made and comfortable"
"Love this blouse! its so darn cute. the fabric is soft, flows nicely and is just absolutely stunning without being over the top. it falls at the lower part of my hip. the softness of the fabric would make this easy to tuck in. the body of the shirt, sleeves, cuffs and placket are contrasting florals in black and creamy white. the top part is a brownish burgundy color and the flowers/butterflies are embroidered in goldenrod yellow, peach, creamy white, two mauve tones, turquoise and brown. the li"
"I am 5'3"" 130 and curvy and this dress fit me perfectly. it's great for parties and weddings (depending on how formal). the only reason i gave it four stars is because the fabric is a little strange; the ribbing for the squares is almost like a pillowy fabric, and it feels a little bit on the cheaper side but luckily it doesn't look cheap. nonetheless, i love this dress and would definitely recommend!"
"Love this dress! just wore it last night to an early valentine's dinner. very classy, simple, but gorgeous. i'm a size 2 in just about everything but i always buy a size 4 in retailer dresses because i'm tall (5'9"") and have broad shoulders and a long torso, and sizing up in dresses works better all around. i am also not busty (32b). i did get this in a 4. this dress was a little awkward at first trying to hook and then zip but once i got that down it worked. the hook is right up under your"
Fits very strange. odd cut. does not look well on.
"This is a beautiful top. it extended longer than i had hoped and a petite size was not available, so i ended up returning it. but it is beautiful and the tassels on the sides make it truly unique."
"Love this blouse! i took a chance on ordering it and wasn't sure what i would think. this blouse is fabulous!!! it has a boho-chic flair to it in a sophisticated way. it's one of those ""special"" pieces from retailer; elegant, quirky, sophisticated.
the details are great, too. of course the embroidery is beautiful; but there are a couple more fun details. the cuffs on the sleeve have multiple buttons; so that you can button them tight or just enough to roll the cuff once. when the cuff is r"
"This is a timeless top. i loved the overall look of the top and after eyeing it for several days decided to purchase it. warning, the shoulder area is cut small due to the fabric at the top. i am usually a size 12 (because of ddd chest) but i bumped up to a 14 and it was perfect."
Love this top! it is super flattering with a long floaty body. i usually wear a 4 but sized up to a 6 due to the reviews and am happy with it but think a 4 would have fit as well.
Love tanks and this one is sweet and flowy. great with jeans/shorts or slacks with a jacket for the office. beautiful yellow floral with fun straps in the back that you can wear with a bra. front neckline is cut narrow so bra straps show but with nude or plastic straps it's not that big a deal.
"This is truly unique top, the  detail around the neck is a nice change!!!"
"I am 5'2"" 125 pounds and i bought the 4p. the fabric is high quality and does not cling at all but instead drapes and in a very flattering way. add that to the cut of this jumpsuit and you have elongating, very flattering lines. i could not be more pleased and regret not having bought this item earlier, since i would have enjoyed wearing it during the holidays. as other reviewers said, it is adorable and a winner."
Very nice fabric but disappointed in the stitching on the knees. it looks nice but makes the pants very uncomfortable and tight around the knees. too bad because i love the style and hoped they would work!
"Very cute flowy fit. i am generally a size small, 32-d chest. because the material has no give it fits perfectly (just barely) if it was any smaller or i was any larger it would be too small. very cute design."
"My store had this and i was so intrigued with its nearly $400 price tag that i decided to play dress up. the colors in person match the colors online, so that was nice to see consistency. overall though, i feel like a dress of that price would need to make me feel like a million bucks, which it did not. most items that fit my slender frame are too short, and this was no exception. the xs fit but i wouldn't be doing much moving, walking or dancing in this dress, which brings me to the question of"
"I saw this online and thought, hmm, no. then saw it in the store, touched it, and the fabric felt so soft. i am normally an 8 petite in cartonnier, but the only sizes available were 4 and 2 regulars in-store. the 4 just looked promising. i thought i'd try it on for laughs. but it is soooo cute i ended up taking it home. the 4 regular fits perfectly on my curvy on the bottom, 5'2, 145 lb figure. my measurements are 34(b)-29-38, and i was shocked how well this fits in a 4 regular! perfect length a"
"Great little transitional piece. i bought the blk/blk floral one & it's not your usual top. sort of quirky & one of a kind looking. i think it's crazy comfortable & i just love it! even its a bit chilly outdoors, toss on a scarf round one's neck & head on out. not the kind of top you'd wear with a jacket."
This top has a western look with lots of black and some burgundy shades.  it is very cute and the fabric is soft.
"I was lucky enough to get a hold of this intarsia sweater dress after the sale and i wish i had purchased this the first time round. it is absolutely stunning, flattering, comfortable and unique! i am 5'3"" and the regular hem fit me just fine at the ankles. i think this dress runs both tts to a bit large so i would size down if your small framed and stay your usual if your busty or broad shouldered. perfectly complements my taupe booties that i already owned and a my taupe maxi sweater that has"
"These run very small!! they are also short, almost like a crop pant. the fit was so weird that i won't even exchange for a bigger size."
"I purchased this top in a great sale! fits great,true to size i am xsmall-small for reference, purchased small. i ended up putting a bandeau bra on with it to feel more comfortable. it would be great in the fall with a cardigan/ sweater, or a blazer. super cute to wear alone in summer with jeans!!"
"I am returning the dress because it smells heavily of the last purchaser's deodorant and perfume. it was actually nauseating to put on. i am disappointed with retailer that i was sold this dress, full price, in this condition. otherwise, the dress is lovely. it is true to size. i am 5'5"" 110 lbs and the size 0 was perfect."
"First, my husband had to help me zip up in this interesting but awkward design. the materials is nice, but stiff, so the skirt is quite full. the shoulder idea is interesting, but i would not want to spend an evening in it. to me, not up to the usual ms standard."
"This is as beautiful in person as online, but the length is shorter than the description, and the arms are tight! although i am 5'1"", i normally wear regular sizes in retailer just fine; however, the 28"" length scared me off, so i ordered a 2p. it says it's 26.25"" long, but it's actually just about 24"". and my normal sized arms struggled to fit into the sleeves - yikes! but it's gorgeous and was purchased with a gift card, so i will keep :-)"
"These pants are so soft and so comfortable! i was absolutely in love at first sight. however, i got the petite, because i am 5'3, and they were still a little longer than i like my pants to be. i wanted them to hit right above the ankle, just like the photo, however, they are a tad longer. i still love them and they are still as comfy as ever, so i am gonna deal with the length!!"
"I just tried on this dress in the store, in red, and i loved the off the shoulder design. the color is just as pictured online (a light poppy red). the neckline began a few inches below my collarbone and was super flattering. however, the skirt portion of this dress flared awkwardly at the hips, causing my hips to look much wider than they really are (and also disturbing the otherwise clean lines of the dress). it seemed to me that there was too much fabric at the back portion of the skirt than"
It looks like you are wearing cargo shorts. really unflattering. avoid buying this skirt

"I ordered a petite medium in black, and it fit great great. some of the other reviews said it was tight, but i found it pretty loose and flowy. also felt it was plenty of coverage - wore it to work (casual workplace) and transitioned to happy hour beautifully."
"I had been on the hunt for a plaid bomber to rock this fall and this retailer edition bomber surpassed all of my expectations! it literally pairs great with everything fall.. chokers, boots, dresses; you name it! it also fits very true to size. not too fit to your body, and a little loose, but not too loose.. just like a bomber jacket should! i highly recommend this product."
"I am pear-shaped and often have a hard time finding pants that fit just right. these did the trick!! they are slim in the waist, but have plenty of room for bigger hips. the overall fit is body skimming/hugging, but they are not tight or uncomfortable in any way! and i have no gapping at the waist. the fabric has a slight sheen to it and a little stretch, but they will be a perfect pant for the office. for reference, i am 5'4"", 34/26/38, and i got a 6 regular."
This jacket is well-made and smart looking. it gave me just the boost i needed today at a difficult meeting. thank you retailer!
"Perfect fit. did not lose its shape. thicker material. great quality for a great price. definitely  a wardrobe  staple. can be dressed up or down. work (business) appropriate. fits tts. for reference,  i am 5'0"", 109lbs, and the 00 petite fits perfect. falls right above ankle like pictured. if they had more colours, i would get them too :)"
"This is a great lounging dress or a great beach cover up. i ordered up a size after reading other reviews. although, i feel like my normal size would have been fine probably. i ordered the black and it is not see through. it's very light weight and comfortable. i may even order in another color just because it's so great to wear around the house."
"The fit on these pants is just right for me. i have curvy hips and a slender waste and legs. these pants don't gap in the back, as fitted pants often can. easy to dress up or down. the color hasn't held up as well as i hoped, so take care when laundering."
Ordered the navy and aqua in medium. the aqua fit a lot tighter than the navy seemed to be a different fabric and less stretchy. loved the color on both but returning the the aqua. normally wear size 6
"Very comfortable fabric and fits nicely. i am 5'10"" like it states the model is, and it falls shorter on me that viewed, but still looks nice. it will be an easy dress to use for different looks."
"When i tried on this bathing suit, i decided to not try on any others. it was just right! i usually find bathing suit shopping difficult and no fun--as i can never find a suitable bathing suit. this suit looks nice/flattering, and i can also move around in it and it stays in place. i purchased it in the navy and i'm going to order it in another pattern as well. it looks modern and classic; it's a chic style. i'm a size 6 in dresses, and i purchased a size 10 in this bathing suit."
I have bought other leggings at retailer and they were fine. these run small. i have to return.
Love love love these leggings and what an amazing price point!!!
This is a great beach/pool or lounge piece. i debated keeping but couldn't pass up how comfortable it was. hugging without being tight. i will probably only wear it with some sort of layer like a jean jack or tied shirt rather than undone unless on on the beach but it's so comfortable. straps are a bit long.
"The colors and fit of this suit are even better than described. it is the most comfortable and flattering one-piece i have ever tried on. 

as noted by other reviewers, there is limited support in the chest; this suit will keep you covered but does not provide lift."
"I had been looking for a one-piece that is fashionable yet practical. fabric is beautiful, fit is impeccable, no complaints on lack of support. i find if you tie it tight up top it's very practical. this was the perfect choice for me. i am 5'3"" 120 lbs and ordered the small."
"This is a very comfortable and sexy sleep dress, the way it drapes. i can see that the type of fabric is not suitable for out and about activities and can catch on snags, etc. very easily. once i relegated it to the nightgown category it became my favorite item to wear and lounge in."
These sold out in my size 16 before i even knew they existed! (probably a great indication that your in-between and plus-size customers are hungry for more options from you). please restock so i can get in on this apparently-perfect pant!
"I love this top! i gave it a four star because i wish it were a tad longer. i am short... 5'-1 and it does work for me, but i do tend to like my tops longer. very cute and airy in the back!"
This suit fits like a glove! i've had five kids and am currently nursing my last baby so i was looking for a suit to wear to the beach this summer when i'm just not feeling a bikini. this is it! it's comfortable and not binding easy to nursing and swim in. overall worth the extra splurge. i'm tall too so it was plenty long on my torso.
"Cute top! the bright red crochet shoulders and back add the perfect pop of color to the light blue pinstriped front. it's a little loose and boxy around the bust area but overall i think it's a flattering shape. i got the regular s and don't find it too short. for reference i'm 5'2"", 134 lb, 34b. i often wear petite sizes but due to other reviews mentioning that the top is short i ordered the regular size and am happy with the length and fit."
This top looked super cute online but when it came it was super short and boxy. looked like a tent on me. this one went back the same day it came!
"Comfy easy dress. i bought the black version. fabric is so soft. i wear this around house, but don't hesitate to run out in it if needed. i bought medium so it was roomier and for length since i'm tall. small also fit, but was shorter than i wanted."
"Uncertain about sizing i got both the 4 & the 6...both made me look like a no-asser :( neither fit quite right in the leg. both hit at a weird point in my calf, not cute-short, just off. (i'm 5'8"" and 125#) to quote my husband, ""nope. not feeling these."" that said, they feel great on, seem to be made well, but are heading back to an retailer near you :( sigh. the quest continues :)"
I love this dress for day and night time. the back detail is cute and works well with a racerback bra. it runs big though. i'm normally a small in dresses and the arm holes are too big in the size small on me. it was also generally too big all over. i like the length and the weight of the fabric. i purchased in the off black color.
"I had my reservations given that i'm petite (5'2"", 108lbs) and it's midi style. i'm glad that i took a chance. i bought the red motif and it's beautiful. it's wrinkle-free right out of the package. the color is vibrant and the style is classic and effortless. fits true-to-size. great for work with a black tee as shown in the picture."
Cute comfortable top. fits well and will look great with skinny jeans.
I got the shorts and the blue motif they're really comfortable and will look cute with a tank top for the weekend.   they true to size them usually a size 4 to 6 and i got a small and that works.
"I purchased this dress in black and love it. its hot where i live so i am always looking for a lightweight dress that i can throw on either after the pool or out and about. i wore it to an outside concert with sandals and a simple braid, it was perfect! considering ordering it in another color!"
Perfect fit! can be dressed up or down! more colors please!
This is a great pant to wear to business and when you just need something more than a jean. not so skinny a 50+ woman can wear comfortably..
"These are great pants. i love the fit and the taper of the leg. these will be my ""go to"" black pants for the fall season!"
"I got this to wear as a beach cover-up over bathing suits. if you purchased a darker color and were small chested (i.e., you could go braless, since a bra won't work well with the low back and armholes), you might be able to pull this off as a very casual dress. i bought this in a xs in the coral/peach (i'm 5'7"", 129 lbs., 32dd) and it's not super see-through, but i'd never be comfortable wearing it as a dress on its own. as a beach cover-up it's cute and comfortable, but as a dress it would be"
"I love the fit of these pants -- they're the perfect slim black pants. however, i wore these pants exactly three times before the seams split the middle of the pant in not just one, but multiple places. disappointed by the workmanship/quality of the product, especially since the pants fit amazingly and don't sag like other slim fitting black pants tend to do. i hope retailer will take this into consideration and improve the quality of future iterations of this product."
This is a great casual summer dress. cute as a cover up but in the black you can definitely wear it for daytime. if you're feeling bare throw on a white button down or chambray.
"I waited three months for these pants. when they finally arrived, i was mostly pleased. they seemed like the staple pant everyone is raving about. and they should have been.
problem one: they bag out. i got one wear out of them before i needed to wash and hang to dry (regained shape then).
problem two: the crotch split! in the front! i'm a teacher. i sincerely hope no one noticed! i read other reviews about this problem and don't know if i got a bad batch or if a similar fate is awaiting other"
"This is a great silhouette and the red/black plaid will be perfect for fall. it will look great with black bottoms or with jeans. the only reason i gave it 4 instead of 5 stars is that the outer shell fabric (the plaid) is a rayon twill that is a little bit lightweight for the silhouette, so it is bagging out a little around the zipper and the pockets. i'm hoping the quality will hold up. i bought this same jacket in a heavier weight camoflage printed tencel this spring from the same brand, and"
"This swimsuit fits exactly as i had hoped. i purchased it in the teal dot and it is a little brighter than in the photos, but i ended up liking that better. it is well made with thick (but not too thick) lined material. also, i was initially worried that the deep v-neck may be too deep for my liking, but once i had it on,it looked classic and not showy. i love the suit."
I love these pants. i bought as basic pants to dress up or down and they look good with flats or heels. also i like you can wash instead of dry clean.
These pants are awesome - please make them in other colors besides black and navy!
"This is an amazing swimsuit. i had been on the hunt for the perfect one piece. i wanted something a bit on the modest side, but still sexy, and i hoped for a unique print that would make it stand out. the icing on the cake would be a suit that is functional enough to either lay poolside or scuba dive. enter this swimsuit from retailer. i fell in love with the teal dot print as it's unlike anything else i've seen - it's absolutely spectacular in person. i love the vibrant blue and the chic d"
"I really love these pants. just the right fabric, not too thick. so comfy. i do feel they run a bit big. they stretch out quickly so if you are in between sized, choose the smaller one."
"Like others, i finally received my size 6p black pants after months of waiting.  for starters, these pants run small, so i ordered a size up but still in petite, because i adored the red ones i got this past summer.  when the black pants arrived, they were a full three inches shorter than the red ones (which were also 6p), and the fabric did not feel anywhere close to the same quality.  i'm debating ordering the regular length, but i'm not sure i'll bother, based on some of the other reviews."
"I had been searching for a swimsuit that flattered my baby bump and this is it - i'm in love! for reference, i am 5'6"",170-180, 10-12 or m-l depending on the item. however, i'm currently 19 weeks pregnant so im about 185 and growing - so i went with the xl swimsuit. i have a 36c/38d bust and although there is no true support in the top of this suit, it holds the girls in and the deep plunge is just the right amount of sexy. the bottom has modest coverage, showing just a little bit of cheek. i go"
I bought the first skirt at the store. loved it so much i went online and found this one and bought it too!
"I put this runs small but it's a little more tts, except the arms are very slim! if you like to push your sleeves up like this model, you will have to wait for a while to see if the sweater loosens up. length wise it fit me a bit longer than this model and i'm a petite. the color is also darker and not as red as in this sweaters, which i actually prefer. the sweater is much thicker than my other cashmere sweaters. some of the stitching seems stick out as if the sweater is worn inside out, but th"
"So i recognized the fact that this dress was likely intended more for lounging than for wearing out and about, but i once had a lot of luck with dresses of this price point (and intent) at retailer, so i had hopes. i was just wanting it to be a great addition for vacations and beach days, but it's honestly so thin i couldn't even see it working that well for that. it's also cut smaller than i was anticipating judging by the way it fits the model; my usual small was way more bodycon than i was anti"
Love the fabric fit and cut of this skirt. it hits at just the perfect spot but runs a little large and is more flattering when sizing down (atleast on me) .
"This is by far the cutest, most glamorous one piece i have ever tried on! it fits perfectly and is flattering in the right places, it doesn't show too much cleavage and is modest enough for family events. absolutely love this suit in navy. wasn't in love with the rest of the patterns, hoping they come out in more solid colors someday soon!"
"I don't normally try on tops like this but i liked the product shot so much that i wanted to repeat the outfit. i grabbed a large because it wasa shorter blouse. it was huge. i sized down to the medium and it was still loose but if i were to purchase, it would be that size. the red against the blue was very pretty but i didn't know if felt like a little kid in a uniform. the back did not lie flat, not sure if it was because of my 36d chest or because of the shirt design. it is well made and i th"
I love this ankle length pant. it is so comfortable wear it with a tunic or tee. i can wear this for 3 seasons!
"I think this is the first time i've successfully purchased pants online. i normally have to try a bunch of styles and sizes on before i find the right ones. i gave it a shot with these, and bingo! they are great! they are a bit longer on me than on the model, because i am 5'3"" and did not order a petite. i still like how they look, hitting just above my ankle. just the right blend of conservative and cool for lecturing in front of college undergrads."
"Such cute, soft and comfortable shorts. can be worn as night wear or out and about."
"I saw these in an email and immediately went to the web to look at them. they fit well and have nice slim look. the bottom of the legs seems to fit a little slimmer on me than in the picture, but they aren't too tight."
"Received many compliments the first day i wore them.. amazing fit. disagree with the other post. the
quality is amazing. i wish they had other colors. bought xs"
"This is one of the most comfortable swimsuits i own. i purchased it in the turquoise dots print and found that it was colorful and perfect for a beach getaway. the adjustable halter style makes it really comfortable, yet cute. i highly recommend this suit to those looking for a unique, yet whimsical swimsuit style."
"Great swimsuit, love the fabric and pattern. the top lacks support."
"This dress is the best casual find. goes with everything- flips flops, tennys, jean jacket. feels little sporty and the orange was a cool addition to my closet."
"I tried this on in the store and was disappointed because it looked so fresh and vibrant on the hanger. but it's basically cut for model-sized people only. it's short and wide, and if you have any boobs at all it'll make the back pucker. i can't imagine this will look good on most women."
"I really wanted this skirt to work but it didn't look very flattering on me. a great midi length and very cool pattern, so hopefully will work for others!"
"These are really cute. nice fabric. i love the rise...not to low, not too high. but they are going back. i'm a size 4. i got these in a 4. they fit fine in the waist and bum but they are tight around my calves. also, they were more like ""high waters"" on me than cropped so a petite in the length probably would have worked better for me had these fit."
This top is gorgeous! this is why i love retailer the quality is amazing. i just love how unique this top is. it's a light jean blue and white pin striped shirt with these beautiful red crochet sleeves. i'm a 34ddd i ordered the large and it's perfect. it is a bit shorter probably because of my chest but i was going to wear it with high waisted shorts anyways.  it's a must buy!
"Sale price is a great price for a cute cover-up.  so this is not a polite company dress.  this is a ""i want to show off my cute underwear/bikini/cross-fit bod while i go get a cold pressed juice in venice"" kind of dress.  or you can just wear it at home like i do.  runs small btw, so size up."
"These fit me really well. i tend to have a problem finding trousers that fit my more muscular legs and my waist. usually, if it fits my legs the waist is too big. the trousers have some stretch for a better fit. the only downside is that i had go them hemmed (bought regular size)."
"I am normally between a size 0 and 2, so i ordered these pants in both sizes to make sure i would have a nice pair of black crops to wear to work. the 0 seemed pretty tight all around, so i returned the 0 and kept the 2 even though there was a little bit of room in the waist. of course the size 2 after a few hours of wearing had completely stretched out, was bagging in the crotch area, sliding around on my waist and creasing badly behind the knees. i doubt i will wear these pants more than the o"
"The material and construction of the pants are great, but the length is just plain awkward. i'm 5'4"" and the regular came to just above my ankles, and looked as though they had shrunk in the wash in a really bad way. a couple of inches longer and they would've been fine, or i could've gotten them in petite and worn them as true ankle-length pants, but the regular just didn't do it for me. also i'm usually a size 6 (5'4"", 125lbs) and these were a little baggy around the waist and hips."
"I often find wearing anything described as 'slim' difficult, but these pants are absolutely wonderful. i bought in a size 12 regular length. they are perfect, both in fit and quality."
This midi skirt has a really nice drape with great seasonal colors! can't wait to pair it with my wine color booties!
"I ordered these in a size small on sale, thinking that because of the material, they might not fit. they are actually very cute, and fit in the waist/legs, but in the crotch area, as another reviewer mentioned, they could fit a little better. they look fine with a longer top so i decided to keep them."
"Unique design. love the collar and broad cuffs. the xs regular fits me better than the s petite, which is a bit short."
"I bought this dress in the cream color. it was sold out online in most sizes but i stumbled upon it in person and immediately had to have it. i'm usually xs or small, and bought the small. they did not have an xs available so i can't compare, but the small was flattering and comfortable. i'm 5'5"" 120 (34c) and it falls perfectly at my ankles (no dragging) and looks great with simple, neutral sandals. as some reviewers have mentioned it has some weight to it, so it's probably not great for hot da"
This is a fabulous style top! highly recommend this top. comfortable material. retailer is consistently tried and true to a classy style!
"This dress is gorgeous, but i should warn all the tall ladies out there that it fits quite awkwardly. i'm 5'10"" and tried both the petite (thinking it would fall more like a midi), and the regular, hoping it would fit like a maxi should. both hit at a very awkward spot on my mid-shin... as much as i loved and wanted it, it looked too weird to justify buying."
"Love the coral color - so pretty in person. it is slightly lower cut on the chest than i expected. 
this is a great top for the weekends!"
"These are the perfect leggings. they're so soft, and they don't stretch and droop throughout a day of wearing them. i ordered the grey and moss, and they have different textures, which is fun."

This cardigan is very cute in the picture and i really wanted to love it but it just didn't seem worth the price. the material is kind of itchy to me and i wasn't a huge fan of the wide edges in the front. the colour is very nice and feminine.
"I never buy anything at retailer full price, but had to get this when i tried it at my local store, especially since it's back ordered for so long. it's very flattering, and super comfortable. fully lined, not see- through at all. elastic waist that's hidden under the sweater top. will be so easy to throw on and dress up for an evening out, or lounge in after a day at the pool or beach. looking at the model pics, i was concerned the arm pit holes came too low, but on me that is not the case. the t"
This sweater is unique and really pretty.  i got so many compliments and i felt really girlie wearing it - it is so fun.
"I just saw this in the store and loved it! it is shorter than pictured on the model, but it's not short. with a long shirt underneath, i'll wear it with leggings. the color is beautiful!! the size does run large - i normally wear a large at retailer, and i got this in a medium. i can't wait to wear it all fall and winter long!"
"Very fun and comfortable pants that will bring you many compliments. they do fall open when you sit down, though they have liner shorts inside for coverage. they are not appropriate for work but will become a wardrobe favorite."
"I don't typically write bad reviews, but this dress is so bad and i want to save someone else from buying it. i read the mostly bad reviews and still purchased anyway (my fault i know). the dress is super stiff ( i know denim can be that way and it is possible it would soften up after a few washes). i'm typically a 6/8 and the size small swallowed me, and the xs was big everywhere except through the bust (i ordered both sizes to try). i wouldn't recommend buying this if you are a size 8 or small"
"These pants! great casual pants, i've received so many compliments! mainly because they are flowy, and the open panels make them different! with the weather so hot, they are perfect for keeping you cool. very pleased with this purchase!"
"After reviewing the comments for this dress i was really hesitant about buying it online, so i finally went to the store and all of the reviews are 100% true. this dress is amazing in terms of quality, but the sizing makes zero sense. i'm normally a size 12, but based on the reviews i initially tried on a medium. even that was huge, arm holes so long you could see my entire bra. so i tried on the small and that fit perfectly. unfortunately, unless you're normally an 8(maybe) or above in sizing,"
"Loved the style, ordered my normal m- fit tts though i thought i would potentially taper the sides to make less boxy (with a larger bust and shoulders, boxiness is unflattering). the slight boxiness looked perfect with stretchy, fitted business slacks. midday, i held my ipad up to my chest and the velcro from the cover pulled an entire lychnis delicate threads. not just snagged- i had to gently separate the threads from velcro grip. needless to say, it pulled the threads out by at least 1/2 an i"
Nice basic top...i will get plenty of use out of this! love the neckline.
"I'd been eyeing this dress since i first saw it in the dress catalog when it came out. when i saw it in person, it was just as beautiful as i remembered! i'm about 140 lbs and usually wear a size s or m, but i tried the s on and decided to size down to an xs, because the linen flowy fabric lays a bit wide when on the body; however, the s would have worked, too! i'd say size down if you prefer your clothes a tiny bit more fitted. the fabric is beautiful and lightweight, even though there is more"
"I have been searching for a pale pink sweater for fall. the color and fit is much prettier than the way it is photographed here. i think it will look great over denim, grey, or olive green dresses and shirts."
Don't buy this dress unless you are normally a medium or larger. order it one or two sizes smaller than your normal size. i ordered an xs and it's more like a medium or large.
"I got this in blue and also in white, both size medium. it's a very comfy casual top and i love the horseshoe neckline and front facing seaming which makes it just a bit different. however....i can't figure out why the blue color fits quite a bit smaller than the white. but it does, so consider this when you order, depending upon how you want it to fit. i'm keeping both but will wear the blue in a different way, definitely not with leggings."
"I think the model is wearing a larger size, per the first review. i am 5'2"" and 105 lbs and the xs fits about the same in length but not nearly voluminous. so you should order up if that is what you want. this will be perfect for some long summer flights instead of a wrap, since the sleeves will be more convenient and i always look schlumpy rather than elegant in a shawl! if it had some cashmere or another softer fiber i would be totally in love with it."
I ordered the white solid & the white w/blue stripes versions in size xl. both fit me true to size. the fit matches the model's photos. i got these on sale and they're worth that price. they're great basics to have. the white/blue striped one is my favorite. it such a pretty combo. i love the unique neckline too. fun details for a basic tee.
"I found this at my local store and ended up buying both colors. the fabric is thicker than a t-shirt. these will go with so many things....jeans to dressy skirts. i normally wear a small but ended up buying the medium (2). the small fit me but was a little too short (for reference i am 5'8""). these will be a staple in my wardrobe all year round. love!"
"The colors and print are absolutely beautiful and i'm quite heartbroken that this suit just doesn't fit. i don't have a long torso but the v was just so plunging that i wouldn't feel comfortable leaving the backyard lounge chair in this bathing suit. no matter how much i tied the halter it still revealed a v halfway down to my naval. the strange thing is that there seemed to be too much fabric on top, lots of ruching and thicker straps than i would normally go for, and while i'm only around a b"
This sweater has the perfect slouchy shape for fall. i wish it were a little bit softer and heavier - the fabric is pretty lightweight - but it layers beautifully and will be a staple for me this season.
"The overall styling was great, and the dress is super-cute, if a little thick (it's made of denim, after all). i ordered a size down from my normal, and even then, i was swimming in it. the worst part, and the aspect that will make me return it, is that the arm holes hang down so low that i'd have to wear a tank top under the dress. i'm returning it, though it is really cute and i love this brand. the arm holes killed it for me."

"Marking down one star because these pants do gape quite a bit when you sit down, though i appreciate the shorts underneath that prevent any indecent exposure. these could have done with a little stitch in the front or side somewhere on the leg to limit that. that said, my other similar (non-retailer) pants that are much worse and are also are bulkier on top, which does not look great at my size/with my body shape. these are more flattering (i love the band on top) and comfortable. i am normally a"
"It is seldom that i write a review about a tee, but after receiving the jessa tee in the mail today, i just felt compelled to do so! the deal is, this tee is pricey for sure, but in my opinion, it is worth it! as another reviewer said, the cotton fabric is hefty; in fact, it could also be called a ""lightweight sweater."" everything about this tee is perfect and classic: the elbow sleeves, the nice neckline, and the semi-boxy, semi-cropped fit. it will go with everything from jeans, to nice slacks"
These leggings are some of the softest i own. i ordered both the black and the moss and each has a distinct pattern. they are perfect for colder climates and fit me like a glove.
I took this sweater on a recent vacation up north. i wore it 3 evenings because the weather changed from hot to cool. loved the feel of being wrapped in a warm blanket. cocoon cardigan is an apt name. wasn't sure about pink but it is exactly as pictured. this will become a go-to in my sweater wardrobe.
"I normally wear a size 2 so i ordered a small and an small petite, i will be keeping the small because the small petite looks like a shirt on me, my height is 5'4"". it runs very big underneath the arms as well. the design is so unique i will be keeping it."
"This dress is still super cute despite its shortcomings. i agree with other reviewers that it definitely runs large, and very small petite/thinner ladies might feel it's overwhelming. it worked for me in my usual size l though. for reference i'm 5'3 and this hit just above the knee. and while the dress is ""roomy,"" a smaller size would likely have been tighter or pulled on my fuller (36d) chest as there's not much give in that area. i agree that the armpit holes are ridiculous, but a thin camisol"
"So comfy and stylish. love the color, i purchased the indigo/blue. nice fit, relaxed fit....not fitted. might have to get another color. it's fun to have a tee with a different design detail (neckline). i'm 5'7 145-150 lbs and ordered the medium. a smaill probably would have worked too, since my shoulders are a bit narrow. but mediumd is fine:)"
"I love this sweater! it is true to size and not itchy at all. i am 5'5"" and i bought the small. other reviews said it wasn't as long as it looks pictures but it is the same length on me as it shows on the model. you can wear this with so many things! i can't wait for fall so i can wear it."
"The coral is stunning. the shirt has a slight flare at the bottom that you can't see in the picture, it isn't a straight cut. the sewn edges are rough style making the shirt right for casual wear with jeans, or dressing down something fancier."
"I received this sweater in last week, when i opened the package i thought for sure that this sweater was going to be itchy , it is not , the styling is great and very flattering for the price this is a great value."
"I'm a 110 lb, shorty with a short torso and long arms so the standard xs was huge. i had the opportunity to try on both the xxs petite and xs petite. the xxs petite was almost perfect but i wanted it more flowy - probably best for those that are even shorter and more lightweight than me, othewise, it looks a little too boxy. the petite xs fit me the best and draped nicely, similar to the model in the pink. i had a sweater with this exact silhouette 5+ years ago and wore it to death even though i"
"I bought it in the cream color and loved it so much that i bought it in black too. super cute with jeans! can dress it up too. the only slight negative, if i had to find one, is that i feel like i have to pull it forward, at the neckline every once in a while...it doesn't choke me but just feels like it's heavier in the back so pulls a bit. worth it though! :)"
This sweater is like a giant hug. i wore it today and received so many compliments.
"This is a perfect saturday t shirt for the colder days. great fit; not form fitting with no elastic or rayon, soft cotton with great details. im 5'8 140 ish and the medium fit great. i bought a washed denimy blue in the store but may be coming back for more colors now! the white was to sheer for my taste though"
"I can never resist a peter pan collar, so i bought this top in the ivory. it's so cute! i wore it for the first time today and received many compliments. it's very comfortable, fits well, and looks expensive. highly recommend it!"
"This is absolutely adorable and so flattering! i have the patterned shirt, and i just purchased the white one and the orange one because i like it so much. i am 5 ft. 9"" and 155 lbs. and the medium fits nicely. hope this helps!"
"I love this dress. i'm 5'8"" and it fits me exactly like the model in the picture. i have slim hips and waist, so that helps. i don't think this would be as flattering on someone curvy. i wish it came in another color i like, i would absolutely buy in another color. i got a medium and it fits like a glove."
I bought this a little ago in the denim color. it has become a favorite so much that i bought another in white.
"This is a cool relaxed style with the benefit of an open neckline to add a bit of femininity. i tried on the faded blue and striped colors in the store. the faded blue goes well with the style, but the stripe is cute too. the sleeves are quite long and too tight to roll up, so if you are petite like me you will definitely want to order the petite size- and probably even those you who are in between petites and regular sizes. the sleeves may also be too narrow for some people."
"This is a very pretty dress and looks just as it's pictured.  however, there is a lot of fabric - the lower half is very full and runs very large."

"I wanted to love this dress. the colors are heavenly and it looks light and airy. it isn't, it is very heavy, much too heavy for florida heat. the top layer is a beautiful sand color and while the fabric is nice, the heaviness of the top really weighs the whole dress down. i felt like it added ten pounds to my appearance, easily. back it went, boo hoo. if you are between sizes, i would size down, runs a bit big."
I was not impressed with this dress online but when i tried it on at the store i fell in love. it's a great summer / fall dress. i love the sweater top and linen bottom. so many compliments on it!
"Absolutely in love with this shirt. the neckline is extremely flattering, and the shirt naturally comes away from the body."

"I needed a tee refresher, i had a good feeling about this one so ordered all three colors when they were on a promo, and i'm not disappointed. the neckline is different and works great to emphasize your favorite necklace. the tee holds shape after washing and drying. my favorite is the blue which i like to wear with dark wash jeans as styled on the model. the white has a cream tinge to it and i'm able to wear it with a nude bra without looking indecent. there is a cute little button detail at th"
"The fabric and detailing of this dress is of superior quality, but unfortunately it runs huge-- you definitely need to wear a tank or cami underneath. i am 5'9 145lbs with massive shoulders/smaller bust and i got the xs petite!"
"I think in general it is just hard to buy a bathing suit online, but i really underestimated the v-neck of this suit. i read the reviews and noted it was not recommended for girls with larger size breast. as i'm basically an a cup, i figured i would be fine. the top portion basically has no coverage or hold. even when tied very tight, the top still opened making me feel exposed and like my entire breast would fall out of the suit. needless to say my fiancã© was not a fan of the suit either. even"
"I found this sweater to fit me just as pictured. i am 5'8'', 128lbs and ordered a small. it hits length wise the same as pictured and is just as flowy with a lot of fabric. super cute with a grey top, white skinnys and brown leather sandals. love it!"

"This runs small, i got the size 3 which fits like a medium, not a large. its a bit of an aline shaped knit in a beautiful saturated navy. i loved the elbow length sleeves. i have a large 34g bust and although this fit, it came to the top of my waist and i'm short-waisted. it's a great basic for someone less busty or who likes a shorter length."
"This dress is everything. i'm 5'4, athletic build, 36d and the medium fit me perfectly. the colors are really understated and beautiful and can easily be dressed up or down. i wish the elastic around the waist fell a little lower but that's one of those things only i notice and definitely didn't keep me from falling in love and buying it. can't wait to wear it on vacation next week!"
I love this cardigan! i ordered the pink and it's a really pretty color. i wish it didn't run so big but xs will be cozy all winter.
"I purchased in store to avoid shipping costs. my local stores don't carry xxs, so they are mailing it to me. i usually wear an xs, but it was roomier than i cared for and made it look a bit sloppy on me. this tee is more distressed looking in person than online, as well. i wish it were more refined because the neckline is very feminine & interesting; i would have liked the ability to dress it up more. also, the solid blue and coral are lighter in color than they appear on my monitor. the blue st"
"Very soft and comfy tee. like the interesting neckline. wish the petite neckline was slightly higher, but sleeves are right length and have great cuffs."
"Ordered the xsp (5'4"" about 118-120#, athletic build)...this was huge all over. big in the armholes, too much fabric hanging in the skirt (cream fabric) front and back, not flattering at all from the sides and as long on me as it shows on the model. i love the idea of this and for the right body type (of course) this will be beautiful. it also would not be a very versatile piece for me...the top sweater part is quite thick (lovely) and heavy. in oklahoma this would not work for very many weeks.."
"Love the color, but the fit is just odd and frumpy. the sleeves are shorter than the should be. when i lift my arms, the entire sweater gets lifted. going back."
"Yikes!  quite a smell off of this one- like wet/hot wool.  the color was beautiful, but the sweater is enormous!  strange fit under the arms as well.  this one went back the same day."
"I love the way this t-shirt fits. the horseshoe opening in front is deep enough to add interest, but not too revealing. will look great with layered, dainty necklaces. the sleeves are nice and long - and i have long arms. the length of the shirt itself could be an inch or two longer, but overall the design is nice. not too tight, not too loose. i'm 5' 5"" and 125 lbs - 34c and the small fits me well. fabric is medium weight - could be a little thicker. the brick color is nice and works great with"
"This sweater tee is made from a fine but substantial knit which hangs beautifully and flows over imperfections in your figure. the cut is very 1950's through the sleeves and neckline. it's a little cropped and boxy, just so that it hides your belly and accentuates your hips. it looks phenomenal with a crinolined a-line skirt."
"The blue is a very flattering color. the fit is not. it does not lay in the back like in the photo on the model. instead, there is a lot of fabric that falls in horizontal folds because it does not fall straight because the sides at the bottom are narrower than the mid section. i think i'm going to return it. the neckline is very nice and faltering. the sleeve at the wrist is kind of constricting, though, and long. it doesn't run big at the chest section, just the mid section, then tapers in at"
"This top has a comfy cozy feel while still being flattering. i especially like the generous neckline--adds a uniqueness to it. great shirt for dressing down, but still feeling feminine. i bought two! my husband always compliments me when i wear it."
"I love this sweater. it has quickly become a staple in my wardrobe. i live in minnesota, so a fashionable throw-on-and-go sweater is essential. this sweater fits the bill. i love how soft and warm it is, the cocoon styling adds a fashionable element while the acrylic/nylon/wool material keep it functional (warm and cozy). i love anything with pockets, which this has. i somewhat disagree with the other reviewers who say this runs small or short. i did not find that to be true for me, and i ordere"
"Can be a bit itchy sometimes, i guess depending on your skin. haven't had a problem with the sweater up to now!"
"This dress is perfect. i'm literally wearing it right now. it's crazy comfortable while still being flattering. it looks and feels high quality, and just barely doesn't hit the floor. it makes me feel like a goddess. plenty of room in the bust area, even for me (36dd), and doesn't show bra straps or underwear. highly recommended!"

"I had tried this on in the beige & loved it but could not find it in my size so i got it in the pink.
did not look at good as the beige."
"I love retailer and fell in love as soon as i saw this dress online. being 5'10"" i love a quality maxi dress and this one did not disappoint. however, being 5'10"" also means the top sweater overlay hits me way short. it looks ridiculous. i also thought that this was very heavy for a maxi dress and could not imagine wearing it in 80 degree weather. unfortunately after waiting so long for it's arrival this is going back."
I love this shirt. it would be a fairly basic tee but the neckline makes it fun. it's very soft and comfortable. i bought the white with blue pattern and will probably purchase additional colors.
I love this shirt. the neckline is flattering and the overall feel is very comfy.

"I wasn't going to purchase this dress because it was given 1 star. however, i ordered it and i was so glad i did!!! i'm 5'1, 105lbs this dress fit me perfectly, it really compliment my petite body. i get so much compliments! it is not easy to order anything for a petite frame but this dress really show off my body without showing too much."
I tried this on in the store and had to have it. this is the kind of sweater that you just want to cozy up with on a nice fall or winter day with a cup of coffee in hand. i love the neutral pink color as it will go with everything. i'm a dress and skirt girl and this will go well with those items. it will cover your bum and i love the dolman sleeves. i highly recommend it!!
"Bought this today - cant speak to wear - but overall design is so incredibly cute and flattering. i am usually a small or medium, but went with a medium. so different and wearable! white is sheer so opted for a denimy blue color that i dont see listed available online."
"The sweater is cute, but scratchy."
It was cute. i didn't keep it because it wasn't soft and hung a bit different than pictured. i thought it would be softer material. it was itchy
"I am on the fence about this dress, as you'll see the reasons below, but it is really breathable fabric and extremely comfortable!
_________
pros:
- tons of stretch to the top part. i'm a 36c, so a lot of retailer tops are too snug for women with some bust. however, i fit into a medium here without it being too snug. you could actually go down or up depending on how loose or tight you'd like it to be on you.
- the bottom half, the skirt, feels so nice on the skin. very breezy. it is layered an"
"I love these tights so much i almost want to buy another few pair and save them for when these wear out. the lining is like clouds on your calves. they're thick enough that you don't need to be totally covered by a tunic but slim enough that they don't add bulk. love, love them!"
I am a curvy woman and leggings are new to my world. i am sorry that i did not discover these leggings sooner because they are lovely. they are comfortable and cozy with a great fit. i am 150 lbs and 5'7 and the m/l fit perfectly. i have the black and plum colors. great purchase!
"I was so in love with this dress when i saw it in the store but so disappointed when i put it on. i am 5'10"" with curves and usually buy a large in dresses. this dress looked like a sack on me. the top was way too big and loose making the dress a boxy cut rather than a maxi cut like i was expecting. the dress is lovely to look at on the hanger and feels good on but i don't think it flatters hourglass figures. it was the right length for me unlike many other reviewers. 
obviously, based off the"
"This is huge. i understand that's the style, but it looked like i was wearing my husband's size xxl. i tried to imagine a really cold day when all that extra fabric would be nice... but then it started to itch, and itch and itch!"
The fit is not as shown on the website. will be returning.
"The detail on this dress is lovely -- it's unusual and well-made from soft fabric. it is big though -- i would usually wear a medium and ordered a petite small. to give you a sense of how large it is, i am currently 33 weeks pregnant, and bought this to wear after the pregnancy. i can actually get it on now, over the considerable baby bump. it doesn't look good, but i can in fact get it on. hoping it won't be way too large post-pregnancy, but it seems to fit fine in the shoulders now. definitely"
"I saw the cream color in size regular small in the ""only one left"" section at my local store. i had my heart set on this dress all summer but it was sold out, so i was super excited to see it. the color is true cream, like linen color. i was surprised that the dress is very heavy, as heavy as a medium sized coat. i can't understand why it's so heavy because the top is sleeveless and the dress part is pretty sheer. the dress is about 2"" pass my feet which i wouldn't mind having it hemmed, but the"
There's are just what i was looking for! these are perfect in texture and thickness...not too thick but not too thin. super soft fleece on the inside. i both both the black and green...i will most likely but the grey soon enough.
"I am floored by the amount of positive reviews on this dress! when i received it, it looked nothing like it does on the model. the bottom looked like dirty sand and was completely wrinkled. if you have anything above a c cup, the top looks completely unflattering. i looked so top heavy in this dress! definitely not worth the price. so disappointed."
"Adorable, comfortable dress. the denim is super soft with a bit of stretch. please be advised this dress runs very large, especially through the hips. i normally wear a size 12 and the large was swimming on me. i will definitely be exchanging it for a smaller size."
"This didn't work for me. im normally a m (8/10). got this in xs. that was the correct size for me, i believe. however, the armholes were huge. husband said the top of the dress looked like the autobots symbol from transformers and he wanted me to keep it. but, i sent it back."
"I am long waisted and 5' 120 lbs. 34c. that being said, i purchased a size s regular and it fit perfectly. a petite would have been far too short. so i would recommend a regular size if you're a petite. also i have a big chest and this was very flattering. because of my chest size i usually do best with a v neck, but this classic peter pan collar looks great! i purchased the black. i agree with one of the reviewers who said that the nude color looked like a mess of a weave. the black and white o"
"This is a bit pricey, but it's the most beautiful sweater that i own. it fits beautifully, and the material is soft, not itchy, which is important for a sweater with a cowl neck. the cowl sits beautifully, no matter how you ""fold"" it. and, the pattern both at the neck and the bottom is vibrant and bright, and is just lovely. i ordered a small and it covers my butt, which is perfect for leggings, or even with tights and boots. it's not shapeless, but seems to graze your thighs, and has a mild tur"
This product i better than the pic. nice fit and a nice throw on with boots nap glad i took a chance one it
"I bought this a month ago and returned it. but kept thinking about it so ordered it. it arrived on wed and i wore it on thursday as a dress with tights. i got so many compliments on it. it was perfect for the cool weather and was not too warm.

this knitter thinks the quality of the jacquard knit is excellent. yarn used is top notch."
"I just received this in the mail today. first of all there was no slip included and the fabric is totally sheer. the description says ""viscose lining"" so i assume there was a slip and from the picture it looks like it was a beige color. second of all, it was obviously sent from a store where they lost the slip and it was squished into the smallest possible retailer envelope. the fabric is beautiful but the dress is humongous like the previous reviewers said. i ordered a size smaller than us"
I am six feet tall so this will definitely be a tunic with jeans or leggings but if you are shorter it could easily be a dress. lovely pattern with soft cozy fabric. nice weight and hangs well. definitely a keeper!
"I was so excited to order this sweater but was so disappointed when it came. the knit is somewhat stiff and the sleeves are not as bell shaped as pictured on the model. overall i would of kept it if it were much less money, for the price it is just an ordinary sweater with no style."
"After reading the reviews i decided to give this a try, but it just didn't work on me. i'm 5'8, smaller on top, and usually wear m in retailer sizes. this was ok in the shoulder and arm area but a little too snug for me in the hips. also, the diagonal striping made my boobs disappear and the pattern at the bottom emphasized my tummy and rear. not exactly the look i was going for. back it goes."
"I loved this in the store, but had to order my size. it is true to size - a great length - but the material is very thin and very sheer. i don't think it will carry over into fall - it is more of a summer weight fabric. it is also a little pricey for that same reason - still - its a great basic and i will keep my eye out for it to go on sale."
"I absolutely love this sweater! first of all, it's extremely comfortable. i have been wearing it around the house all day and have no desire to take it off. it's cute as a casual around the house top, but also adorable dressed up with jeans and boots. it drapes beautifully for an effortless chic look. the color is pretty close to the photo and very nice in person. the possibilities are endless for colors to accessorize and match with. this sweater is definitely cropped in length, which i normall"
"Haha, the unifying theme in these reviews seems to be don't trust the picture! i was misled by the neckline, i thought i saw a structured kind of asian-inspired mockneck/funnel thing and instead the top has a foldover cowl which, with my full bust underneath it, refuses to pose as a mockneck for me. overall there isn't much structure here at all. but the print is beautiful and the sweater cozy without being itchy."
"Love the shape and cut of this top but it is so sheer you could see my belly button through it. if it was a dark color i would buy it. wore my regular size small. i'm 5'5""130lbs  and 32dd."
"Has quickly become one of my 'go to' tops. comfortable, cute, looks just like the picture."
"It is the perfect top to wear in the summer, it is nice and you can be somewhat dressy or super casual. i don't like anything too tight around my stomach and this has a nice flow with just the right amount of material."
"This is a beautiful tunic. i wanted it to work so much but i couldn't get past the itch factor. also, the sleeves were shorter than i expected. when i wore a light tee underneath, it didn't move well and looked bulky so sadly it went back to the store. if the material doesn't bother you, buy this. would look great w/ tights/leggings and boots."
"I saw this dress in the window at the portland store, and had to try it on. i was a bit horrified at how huge it was once i got it on--sort of like wearing a tent. no shape at all. one of the awesome dressing room attendants brought me a belt, and suddenly it was the most beautiful dress i've ever had on. it's romantic, elegant, feminine... the fabric is so lovely and the flowy sleeves with the lower scooped back just look fantastic. i can't say enough about how amazing it makes me feel. i wore"
"I ordered size large and find it too boxy and long. love the hem, although the top is too long in this size so it's a bit hard to judge how it'll look in the right size. the sleeves are cute and different, a bit wide and flowing. be warned, it's sheer which is more apparent from the side view. i could clearly see the garment cleaning instruction tag through the bottom side hem. has potential but not enough for me to reorder in a smaller size."
"This sweater was a big let down. i am 5'2"" so i ordered it in a petite. it was so short that if i lifted my arms, you'd see my bra!! there is no way i could wear it without something under it- even with high waisted bottoms. and the bell sleeves look nothing like the pic. the entire sleeve is just wide, and it continues with little increase into the cuff. it is just short and boxy. it is going back for sure."
"I was excited to see this top in person, but once i got a close up look at it (and also tried it on) i was disappointed. first, the color is much more persimmon orangey in person and that's a hard color to pull off for a lot of people. it just pulls any pink or red in your skin and highlights it. 

second, the top was poorly finished. i had to pick up two to try on because the lace was wonky across the front of the first one i grabbed. so much so that the lace was puckered because it had been"
"Love this blouse! the top is true to size...i'm generally a m and decided to try a pl which fit great. the pm was just a bit snug...looked fine but i felt a little constricted in the bust area and thought the pl was better for me. i'm 5'1"" for reference and curvier on top than on bottom. i wore a nude bra when trying on and it totally worked with this blouse. the lace detail is a bit sheer in some parts near the bust line but nothing too inappropriate. i can't wait to wear it down to dinner for"
"This is a beautiful and fashionable blouse. it feels good on as it is made of viscose, it is pretty and feminine. color is great, of course it needs to be your color. i love it and recommend it!!"

"I fell in love with this top when i tried it on at the store. it's a great fall piece. it is see-through around the bust, so a nude bra or any color camisole would have to be worn. my only thing is that it seems a little dressy, so i'm wondering how much i'll wear it. i work from home so everything has to be somewhat casual. so, i do recommend it, but i'm undecided as to if i'm going to keep it. for reference, i'm a 34d with a thin upper body and took a size medium."
"This dress is light, airy easy and comfortable to wear. i love the colors and pattern. it looks wonderful with or without a belt. i sized down from a 6 to a 4. i position the front of the dress material closer to the neck so it flows longer at the back. although i am a size 6 the under slip fits perfectly in a size 4. i prefer the dress without a belt but it also looks good with a belt or a jacket or long cardigan. 
this dress is a keeper!"
"Very attractive and easy to wear. i wore it the night it arrived and wore it again the next night! i love the colors, the pattern and design. this is a stylish tunic sweater. the sleeves are not full length, which i prefer. the sweater is dense - the weave is tight, making the sweater quite warm, but not too warm."
Great tank to wear to work or a night out. fits true to size.
"Stylist at my local retailer recommended i try on this top. as soon as i put it on, i was amazed at how pretty it is. i'm 5'3"" and curvy size medium and the fit is true to size. i would say if you are between sizes, you may want to size down. i didn't have any issues with the lace and the slight v-neck falls perfectly on me. no need to wear any cami. 
my only concern was how wrinkled the top was. i requested to have the blouse steamed before i left the store so that i could see if all of the wrin"
"Not only a beautiful knit but can be worn as both tunic and dress on my short frame. it does not look like a sack tent when worn. very soft and flattering. collar is styled well and can be shaped different ways. pattern and color combo is the similar to the exquisite eira dress. i am 5'3"" and i chose the regular over petite. i only wish the sleeves were longer."
"As others have said, this is even prettier in person. beautifully made, colors are really pretty. it's unique and special. in sweaters i go between sizes small and medium, depending on the cut. i went with the small here because the medium had a bit too much fabric around the hips where i don't need it. it doesn't run large, it's just that i wanted it to be closer fit as i'll wear it with skinny jeans or leggings."

"I wanted to love this. however, the fit was funky and the colors were muted. this is definitely something you must try on in the store. too risky to buy online due to weird fit."
"Ladies this top shrinks!!! i am very disappointed, i was in love with this top and the first time i washed it it shrunk a significant amount. i did not use a dryer, i laid this piece out to dry as i do with the majority of my knit tops and it shrunk. it is a lot shorter and much tighter, especially in my arms. if you love this top i might suggest buying a size up and washing it to fit."
I bought this in black. it's a great long length. i have long arms so the sleeve length is great. it's really soft. only issue is seems to sag a little in the middle instead of being flowy. overall a good tunic.
"I love this top! the sizing was great, and i have already worn it so many times, and received so many compliments! it is great to dress up or down! such a great purchase!"
Purchased in the blue. the color is a little darker than it shows. more of a slate blue. loved the fit. i am tall so it covered perfectly.
"Very slimming, lovely dress.
a nice addition to your fall/ winter wardrobe.
the embroidery is lovely, fabric soft and comfortable. sized perfectly. 
so happy with this beautiful black dress!!!"
"New fav lbd. i am 5 months postpartum and this dress makes me feel like my old self again. it fits right above the waist, with a bow to cinch the waist. love the fit and flare. the top is warm, great for a cold evening out. and the taffeta really dresses it up. love"
"This sweater looks soft and flowy on the model, but in the store it is rather stiff lace in the back and very plain in the front. i did not like the ribbing on the front bottom of the sweater because it pulled in places and didn't lie flat. way too expensive for what you are getting."
"Again, bought this while wearing my retailer colored glasses. i loved the flowiness and color of the dark pink, and was convinced in the dressing room that this top made me look like a chic goddess, mid-vacation on the amalfi coast. i tried it on at home, and it straight up looked like i was wearing a maternity top. since i'm not with child, this one's going back!"
I love the back detail but doesn't feel that comfortable on. i bought in green. it's fitted so get size larger if you plan to layer up. i'm 107 and bought xs size. i should have ordered the s.
I was on the fence about this jumpsuit at first.  i feel the pockets in the back are a little high on my bum.  kind of an unnatural placement.  i sized up so it wasn't so tight fitting at the waist and hips so it made the placement of the back pockets a little better.
"Great for layering and staying warm in the winter. definitely stay on the larger size, the fabric has very little give but is comfortable."
"This shirt is not a good look for a gal with hips. the fit at the top is tight (i ordered a small) but there is so much material at the bottom and if you are a little taller (i am 5'7), it hits at a place that is not flattering. i was hoping for something that hung straight down and would be good with leggings. this is not it...also the material is a little stiffer then i was expecting."
Way to v necked- other than that would be a nice go to top. needs a cami.
"After reading the reviews, i was hesitant to purchase, but glad i did. i'm usually an xs or s depending on the brand, but i got this in a xxs. it fits perfectly and is so cute. does not look like a bathrobe at all. i love it because it's almost like a cardigan blazer...looks like a blazer but feels like a cardigan!"
"I tried this tunic on in my local retailer store. they do not carry petites, so i tried on a regular small (i'm 5'2"", 130lb). the proportions were a bit off. the v-neck fell way too low and there was extra material puckering across the bodice. i definitely think a petite would work better for my height. alas, no petites in-store or online in the color(s) i would purchase. i didn't find the shirt too thin, as some have commented. it's essentially a midweight t-shirt material (but rayon, so beware o"
"Comfortable,t eh fabric is very soft. the embroidery adds a little to the otherwise plain black tunic. lace up neck on trend too. 

i ordered the xxs p, as it is likely loose... that was just fine for me, xs p would have been not as flattering. theo nly problem with that is the sleeves then became a little more snug (workout arms). not too snug that i can't wear the dress, but decided not to keep it only because there are way too many things i like at retailer! (and have to pick). in my wish lis"
"I do think the fabric could be a little more substantial for the price, and was disappoitned that even petites, were again, too long... the color is nice enough (neutral), and they definitely look like work pants. they are true to sice, but i could do the low end of my size range."
I bought this in black and it did require me to wear a shirt underneath as it was a little sheer/see through. i usually wear an xs and i wore the same in this top. the black is very pretty and goes well with some skinny jeans.
After seeing this on anthto's facebook page i was so excited to order. i ended up going to a store and trying on. i couldn't believe it was the same shirts when i first saw it. i thought this ran quite big. and the shape was odd. lots of material in the middle. i am a mom of 3 young kids and didn't want people to think #4 was on the way.
"I ordered this sweater in black and thought it was a pretty design and something different in a cardigan. when i tried it on, it was an odd fit and very boxy and unflattering. i wanted to like it and keep it, but i knew i would not wear it so, unfortunately, it went back."
"I ordered the green, black and ivory because i thought they were so cute. the sweater is short but still cute. the ivory one i will return though. it has sparkle that's not noticeable in the online picture plus when it arrived it had a huge snag in the fabric. i'm actually quite surprised they sent it to me in such poor condition."
I ordered the pink in size xl. the color was pretty. the problem is the material was too thin and tight. it ran at least a size smaller than shown in the photos online.
"I ordered the in the emerald green and it was sent to me with a dime size hole in the sleeve. i am very disappointed, because i love the sweater. by the time it arrived, it was sold out in my size. now, i cannot exchange it for one that is not damaged. if the sweater was not damaged, i would recommend this product."
"This is a very pretty sweater, a bit boxy and short but cute. i am 5'1"" and ordered the regular xs in black. the thing i did not like about this sweater was the gold thread through the back lace. i would have kept this if it was plain black lace. just did not like that look."
"I was obsessed with this dress from the moment i saw it online and was so excited to buy it for my company christmas party. i'm 5'4"", 36c, 145lbs and i ordered a 6. the size was great but the whole cut of the dress was completely off for me. i have a fairly short torso but the top portion of the dress (which is a sweater-like material) hit me far too low on my waist to be flattering; the petite may have fixed it, but then the skirt would've been too short. the pleats were cute but flared out too"
"This tunic is very pretty in black. it is lighter weight than the picture appears and drapes nicely. i'm 5'2 so i ordered the petite, but would have been ok with the extra length of the regular for when worn with leggings, with jeans the petite length will work well. i recommend using the size chart provided. i general wear an xs, but ordered the s, based on the size chart, it's a perfect fit."
"Great, special cardigan. fits like a shrug and a little short but is perfect over a tight fitting sheath. great for broad shoulders."
Cute cute. simple tank with a little something to add interest.
"This sweater is a cute design but did not work for me. i am 5'9"" and this is way to short/cropped and looks awkward. the quality was so so, it looked stretched out in the front. it's getting returned."
"Beautiful top, loved the color but shoulders were totally messed up and not sure if it was from
hanging at store or the way it was sewn."
"I ordered this in two colors, in my regular size. i washed and laid flat to dry....it shrunk like crazy. i held the one i washed up to the other unworn/unwashed one and it was at least two inches shorter. they may both be going back. i am so sad."
I purchased this top in blue and liked it so i ordered the red color. i hated the way the second one fit. i'm concerned the blue will not wear well after seeing the way the second one looked!
It is so simple but elegant and beautiful! i am 5'3 and 120 lb and extra small fits me perfectly
"I love this shirtdress. the lace and collar design pops off the black. super comfortable and love that it has pockets! a keeper, this one not going back ever. i am 5'9 and 140 lbs and the 6 fits perfect. the length comes above my knee, so most likely i will be wearing tights or skinny's underneath."
"This cardigan is nice and the lace at the back is pretty. just be aware that it's definitely a cropped length, which is good for wearing over a dress that you don't want to cover up too much. size up if you want room to layer. the one i tried on at the store had the top button almost falling off, so i didn't buy it."
"You guys, i love this so much! however, within one hour of wearing it, the back seam completely ripped. it fit me perfectly... sadly i&#39;ll have to return the damaged item. really sad it&#39;s all sold out too!"
"I love the soft, slouchy feel of this draped yet constructed jacket. don't expect a crisp fit. i'm not a fan of the menswear look so this jacket is the boho answer to a classic blazer. the one-button closure is easy to wear; the hem curves for a more feminine look. i hesitated before ordering (hoping it would turn up at my local retailer). by the time i was ready to order, the green version had sold out. as it turns out, the copper is even better. it was 86 degrees today, but i wore it anyway!"
Love this shirt with leggings. if you are in between sizes- size down
Unusual color. expensive even on sale.
"I am 5'4"" 140 pounds and ordered the 8 petite. it fits perfectly and is very flattering. the embroidery and lace up neckline thing is really awesome. it gives the dress some character... i am also a fan of the roll-up sleeves. i wish it came in other colors because i would certainly order more than one. the one and only potentially negative aspect, and i say potential because i'm not sure if its an issue or not as i haven't worn/washed it yet is it appears to be something that i may have to iron"
"Oh elevenses, i love your pants..the fabrics, the details, the length. i've found elevenses to be classic work pants. reliable, professional, well made. these are none of those things. the cardinal trousers are thin and the rise feels much higher that's it appears in the picture. the red pair are thin, stretchy and cheap. both pairs have to go back. i'm truly sad."
"I can understand the concerns of another reviewer about shrinkage. i have a few retailer tops made of similar fabric and they have shrunk a bit. this too fits very well, but once i wash it, it will likely get a bit smaller. i ordered a small, but plan to size up to a medium. for ref. 32ddd bust, and the small fit perfectly with a camo underneath...the shoulders seem to be cut small. so if you are busty like me, size up."
The lokka tunic is a perfect go-to top for casual days or nights! pair it with skinny jeans or leggings and you are set! the long sleeves are fitted and long-so they can be bunched at the wrist. i ordered it in both the black and the the pale grey/blue shade. it is a winner.
"I got two of these when they went on sale because i hate paying $68 for a basic top like this.. but for the sale price they are great! comfortable, lightweight, and flattering. the black is a little sheer, but nothing a tank underneath can't solve. a good buy!"
"I bought this in my usual medium and it fits great (fitted at the shoulder, loose below). it looks great with skinny jeans and can be worn casually or dressed up with accessories."
"Ordered this dress online and wasn't sure about the criss-cross neckline feature but i love it! it's absolutely adorable and unbelievably comfortable. the fabric is very soft and lays nicely without feeling too ""baggy"" or frumpy. the embroidery is beautiful. i'm wearing it to a fall event in october and pairing it with my favorite cowboy boots, but it would also look great with flats, heels or booties. totally in love with this dress!"
"I was not shopping for a dress and somehow came home with this. in person the material and embroidery are just so stunning that i found myself picking it up. i was sold after trying it on. the material is very soft, both feels and looks extremely high quality. and for a basic shirtdress, it is amazingly flattering. follows curves without clinging to them. i'm 5'4"", 123 lbs, usually wear a small in tops/dresses & purchased the size 4, which fit perfectly. i'm slightly chesty (34d) so sometimes ha"
"Love this dress! it is super-flattering, and the embroidery is beautiful."
"I am going to disagree with reviewers who say this runs small. i found it very short and wide. that being said, it is meant to be cropped. i ordered a size small and it fit perfectly, albeit a little short. for reference, i am usually a size 6/medium in retailer shirts and dresses."
Beautiful sweater but the material is a bit thinner than i was expecting. but it hangs nicely and the sleeves are nice and long!
"Absolutely gorgeous skirt! so feminine and curve hugging. wish i hadn't found this so late! want it in every imaginable color, but i will settle for the off white.

please bring this style back!"
"Love the design and the gold color, but the seams between knit and lace were a little weird and bunched/weren't smooth. maybe the one i tried on just needed to be ironed or something..."
Great style!
"This top is great - lightweight and flattering.
i can wear it to work with skinny white pants or to the grocery store with jeans. 
i purchased another color because i love the first i got so much."
"Can be dressed up or down. the top part is tight, while the bottom has a beautiful skirt. i'm slightly busty and about 5'6"" and the size 6 is perfect for me."
"The fabric is beautiful, even the lining is lovely. i ordered the green color in a large, as i'm curvy and have long arms. but it just doesn't lay correctly at all - the collar has no structure, even though it's a lapel, and the side vents just pop out - the jacket added about 10lbs, and just looked frumpy. it looks much more tailored on the model. too bad, as i have been looking for a velvet blazer in the color for a long time."
"Love this shirt! i bought the light blue color and its amazing, fits well i love that its long in the back. very comfortable and loose. thinking of buying it in both pinks."
"Great material. a bit loose in the middle / lower half. doesn't belt well. it could be 3"" shorter, considering alterations. i'm 5'7"" the model is 5'10"", so yeah 3"" shorter would be cute!"
Love this cardigan. fits just as i expected. very structured in the front with a bit of flair in the back.
"I loved the cut of these pants and the button accent on the pockets. however, the material was quite thin and the quality was not great- there were multiple snags along the seams. additionally, at 5'8, 130lbs i was swimming in the size 4. i would have tried sizing down if the quality was better."
"This is a pretty sweater. i ordered the red and it is a plum color, not close to red, but it will work well with black, gray and denim. i found the sweater looks boxy from the front but the back is spectacular. it is very well made. no raw edges or seams that are threatening to unravel. this will be nice for casual holiday dressing. i found a longer tank in white works well under this."
"This is silly, but the moss is not brown as pictured but olive green. with that ""said,"" i am going more casual, and i love the ""flex"" of this coat. the shape is beautiful and the lining is fun. i waited two months to get this in close to my size 00. for my style it is a keeper, but this back order situation is not acceptable. don't know whose fault that is?"
"I bought this tunic in black and am seriously considering buying it in more colors. it is so comfortable and very flattering. i am 5'11"", so many tunics are more like shirts on me, but this one is the perfect length to wear with leggings or pants. the v neck is a nice, feminine touch and i love the change in material around the edges."
"I am 5 feet and 120. i ordered a petite small in moss. i have posted a photo below. it's a pretty green. the lining is pretty. the reason i deducted a star is because the lining is very thin and ""slips"" a little when putting the jacket on. but it doesn't effect the way the jacket falls and i wear it comfortably. it's floppy, but not sloppy. i was surprised that each side the fabric is like a tulip. it was a nice surprise. i'm curvy and busty. i have zero problem with it being unflattering. the s"
"I ordered this shirt to wear with a pair of pants that i had to return - which is one reason the top went back as well. it really is cute and i like the exaggerated key hole in the back. i certainly could have found other things to pair with this top, but it came down to the price. i just didn't think it said $118. hopefully its still around when it goes on sale. its very cute. fits true to size."
"These leggings are soft, comfortable and go with everything. love the way they feel."
"Why is it so difficult to find a shirt that doesn't expose half of my bra if i lift my arm? 

this is cute (beyond the arm hole issue) but overpriced. going back."
"I wanted these culottes to work so much! the fabric is gorgeous, but the size i ordered didn't fit. i'm normally a size 28 in pants, and i ordered a size 8. it was way too tight and made me look like i had a pooch in the zipper area. not what i wanted it to be. had to return them unfortunately."
"This dress is most definitely not a maxi! barely goes below the knees. also you do not get the cute detail shown on bodice. there are no folds which were an added plus on picture. waist is higher, not at natural waist. very pretty silk though and still cute. just not as pictured."
"I just adore this top! it is so comfy and stylish. i wear it with a little purple cardigan and feel like an iris in bloom. like other reviewers have mentioned though, the straps are way too long. i had to cut them down and re-sew to make it wearable. before that it just slouched in front and looked sloppy and awful. i tried layering under it, which looked absurd."
"I read the reviews prior to purchasing but loved the pattern so much i had to have it. i was not disappointed however, had i not read the reviews i would have been. it is true the top of the dress is flat and does not have the detail as shown on the model. it also appears to be disproportionate. i am 5'1 and curvy the bottom fits well but the top is large however rectified by wearing a padded bra. since i ordered the petite i was surprised the dress was above the ankle (usually their items are l"
This is more beautiful in person. i love the detail and color. i usually don't like ponchos but this one's shape with the square front definitely sets this apart.
I rarely write reviews but had to comment on these pants. these pilcro pants are my favorite for the fall and winter. they fit beautifully and are a great alternative to jeans. the pants are so comfortable and flattering. love the print and they are so versatile as they can be worn as very casual pants and can be dressed up. i am in my 60's and am always looking for clothes that are stylish without being too young looking for a woman my age. retailer is my favorite store!
"Ditto what the first reviewer said, unfortunately. i was so looking forward to receiving this dress but the one received is not the one in the photos. the graphics are fantastic - still love the boats- but the top is not the same and they've added a fabric belt to the finished dress. the fit was perfect except for gapping under the arms (similar, i suspect, to what the first reviewer reported). i was also surprised by the fabric. based on the photos i was expecting something light and semi trans"
"I ordered these in both the grey and moss, and i love both. they are very soft, very easy, loose fitting casual shorts. i wear them a bit lower on my waist than pictured, so they hit lower on my leg than on the model, which i prefer in these. i am 5'3, 105 lbs, ordered xs. the dark grey ones feel more versatile, like you could throw on anything with them and go. the moss look cute with white/cream summery tops. they washed well (machine, cold, laid flat to dry), touched up with light steam from"
"These culottes are adorable on....if you order up two whole sizes! they run extremely small. fabric is thick, high quality and a beautiful color."
Quality is fantastic but i feel like a 14 would have barely made it's way around one leg! this pant is way small in terms of sizing and not a style fit for anyone over a 6. a lot of fabric in the legs. nice pant but not for this girl!
"Love these pants. corduroy leggings that fit like a skinny pant. comfortable. not too stretchy. maintains shape, even with multiple wears between cleaning. pairs nicely with black, neutral, or buttery yellow tops. fun print. received compliments first time i wore them. sizing is just right also. i'm 5'3. usually wear 26 in denim but have to go up a size for super skinny so i ordered a 27p which fits me just fine."
"Skirt in med fit fine, cute,lightweight, swingy, flirty, fun, almost knee length
i am typically a 10-12
but the pattern which swings up, across, and down made me look wide in the hips as opposed to other clothes i own already
more petite, less curvy girls enjoy!
its going back,sorry!"
"Got the small petite. length is perfect, love the color, super comfy, very pretty. the problem is that you cannot wear a bra because under the armpits is so low that either shows your bra (a lot) or if u wear sans bra you may show your breasts (it's loose all around on top, so very easy to show everything. if i adjust the straps it works but then the waist goes up and it looks like i have a belly. i'm taking to a seamstress to see if she can take in under armpits, if not it's going back. i'm 5',"
"These run small (i am 110 and got a size 4), they were a tad tight on top. the waist fit but felt a little too snug, short from waist to crotch and then bloomed out in a nice but stiff ish material. they are a dark blue animal print. i felt like bozo the clown goes to the jungle. they looked so silly i had to laugh. even with the 20% off, these are going back. not even comfortable to lounge around the house in never mind being seen by anyone in person!"
"These cords are seriously fantastic. worth the price indeed. they are very comfy, have a lot of stretch but do not loose shape! the fun yet muted color design allows an average outfit to have a fun pop. they do run big, i got a 26 and i'm usually a 27. they are also very long! nothing a little trip to tailors can't fix. overall, highly recommended."
"I loved the photo of this dress. upon examination of the dress (and trying it on) after receiving in the mail, the dress shown online is nothing like the dress i received save for the pattern. the dress i received has a side zip as well as a belt and no pleats on the top. the bottom is also cut straight across not as it appears in the photo. turns out it is not as flattering as it should appear."
"Beautiful pajama bottoms. i purchased these as a special treat for myself. luckily, i found a review on another site, stating that these run small, before pirchasing. no one wants tight pjs. order a size up! also, i'm 5'8"" tall and the length is just right. if you are taller, you may find this style too short. i haven't ordered the top, because i'm not sure of the fit, but i'm guessing it also runs small, based on the photo."
I bought this top in my usual size in a small. i'm a 34 d 26 waist. i absolutely love it. i pair it with a red cardigan. very cute.


"I love this sweater combo! as a larger woman, i am always looking for flattering tops. the draping in front covers all the right areas! i wish they made them in more colors!"
"I did not realize that this knitted vest had an attached gauzy under-layer. i can see it now in the photo, but i just thought it wasn't part of the actual vest. when the vest arrived i realized sadly that this flowing under-layer was part of the design. i don't know why because the yarn and vest are lovely without it. in my opinion, the under-layer takes away from the beautiful vest. i guess i could have spent some time and removed it, but at that price i just sent it back. too bad because the m"
This is a perfect fit! i was worried that it would be too short and or boxy. i usually  wear an xs. i have a slightly longer waist though and often xs tops run short or they are overwhelming! this was perfect! it is roomy and long enough without swallowing my frame. it looks nice enough to dress up and wear out and about. great value at the sale price as well!! it is well made and doesn't just look like a run of the mill pullover.
"I like the skirt. that said it is going to the tailor to have some of the fullness taken out. just a lot of material going on, and heavier than you might have imagined. i will wear it fall & winter with white & navy cardigans."
"I think this may almost make it back to the more classic pieces retailer used to have. i tried on the xs in store so i ordered the xxs and xs petite... i felt the usual xs was a little big (again, i think retailer is making things bigger...) my verdict is iliked the length on the regular size better and the xxs fit well. but not much difference (the xs petite was a similar size be the arm hole was higher).
colors are very neutral and warm. i like the addition of the inner layer to make this more wh"
"I ordered these in my usual pilcro petite size 6. they were impossible to button, which is interesting 'cause i also ordered the pilcro wide leg chinos in the same size and they fit perfectly, as usual. but it ended up being ok because i don't care for the speckled, slightly rough material or the contrasting piping. back they go!"
"When i saw this online, i thought it was going to be a thin, summery kind of skirt with a fall pattern to it. it is not thin and wispy, but lined with a nicely weighted navy material and the fabric of the skirt is kind of a thick cotton with a nice swing to it. definitely would work for the fall and cool days or evenings. the zipper pockets look cool too, would definitely recommend!"
"I was excited to see these jeans since they came in petite sizes and had a short inseam... unfortunately after ordering/returning several pairs, i found out that these are actually not petite jeans. please beware that if you are ordering these for the shorter inseam, they are actually 28 in... not 24 in as in the description. other than the inseam issues, they fit like typical paige denim."
"This top is super cute, however the bottom hem is all frayed....couldn't really tell that from the pictures. the ""flutter"" sleeves are too big...looks funny with the fraying...runs a little large as well. loved the color! perfect with white denim!"
"I was looking for a shirt of this style. i thought it was very cute, but it is not ""red' as advertised. it is really a brick orange-y color, which is definitely not what i wanted. very disappointed. sent it right back."
"These lightweight, wide leg pilcro summer jeans are really cute, but did not look good on me. i love the fabric-a slightly 'nubby' no stretch chambray that is perfect for hot weather. the waist was a bit large and there was fabric to spare in the hip area. the legs are very wide, adding to the comfort factor of these! the details are really cute-contrasting fabric at the slash front and rear pockets. i got a size ten in these and they were big-i can imagine they will stretch out with wear so it"
This is a great skirt that could be worn to a wedding or worn more casually with a cool tshirt. it is not too puffy and the inner skirt is stretchy and more fitted. i had to size 1 size down. really nice.
"Wow, i can't believe there were some sizes left at my local store. it was on sale and i maxed out with additional discount for black friday week-end. the size 6 fit perfect and i can't wait to wear. this is a gorgeous skirt and will sell out for sure."
"I love the fabric, since it's fall wasn't expecting it to be light. but its not heavy either. just the right balance.
this is one of those classics. i love the collage like pattern of the fabric.
the fit is true to size and looks great with bootie/boots. (dressed up or down)."
"This is one of those 'i need one in every color' kind of shirts. need - not simply want. it is very well constructed. the fabric is the perfect weight and is sooooooo comfortable. the raspberry is a little more dusty rose than pictured online, but it works. i've only had the shirt a couple of day. in addition to wanting to wear it every day, the fabric has not pilled. i'm short-waisted, and i have not had any issue with the high-low hem or cropped length."
"I really like this skirt - so colorful! the interesting pattern and multiple colors will make this a great fall skirt. i can wear it with pink, burgundy, gray, white, black, and probably many more. can't wait for the temps to drop!"
"This was on display when walked into my local retailer, it's just a beautiful in person. my mistake was trying it on, instant love! i tried on my usual size small & it fit perfectly. i would usually wait for something in this price range to go on sale, but i just had to have this. worth the splurge!"
"These are the best fitting jeans i've ever owned! no puckering near the crotch, and i don't need to have the waistband taken in. they probably run small."
"This dress is so beautiful, the color is even more vibrant in person, a stunning emerald green. it is well made and doesn't go too low under your arm, which sometimes happens with halters. the halter material is a thicker band that gives nice support. the skirt does a little poof near your hips at the top, look at the back view photo online, you can see it there. at first i was surprised by it because i didn't see that on the front view, but then i decided it was fun and flirty. i received numer"
"These pants are perfect!!! they are exactly what i was looking for, and worth every penny! the fabric is more lightweight than any other sort of denim, but still i think i could wear these any season. they look so cute with simple heels and a classic blouse, but they can be dressed down with nice sneakers and a plain white t! so excited to have these in my closet!! love a good pair of fun pants."
Too big and it's not secure enough to wear for swimming.
"I received this skirt today and was very disappointed. i don't know what i expected but it is not as i thought. even though the quality is very good and the fit is true to size, i may return it. the fabric of the skirt is just too busy, at least for me. i am just uncertain and even though i have many tops, the colors are just not matching. white looks better than any colored top with this particular print. i am going to try it on one more time and make a definite decision."
"This top will be perfect for autumn and even winter down in the southeast. i purchased the ""red"" and hoped that it was more of a rust color-lucked in! the material is very soft and more on the thinner side for layering-which is alway a plus. i have spare tires in my belly area and this does not grab aholed of them,in fact the stripes do the work and disguise! and the lace up nautical feel brings the attention to my money maker! you won't be disappointed"
"I ordered this on a whim during retailer days sale and i'm glad i did. it's now one of those shirts that calls my name every morning. i've worn it with denim skinnies and a knee length black knit pencil skirt. so soft and flattering. i got it in the red, but am tempted by the blue!"
"These pants are 100% true to size (whatever that means anymore...i'm a 26 in paige and ag.  i'm 5''6, weigh around 115, have long legs and i ordered the 0p.  the zero petite are still a little long, with a slight heel they're perfect.  they don't have stretch in them, but do to the fit and fabric...the material does expand, because they're thin and breezy.  i absolutely love them.  can't wait to order other colors of the same style.  these are my new favorite pants."
"I ordered this skirt online in a size 8 but returned for a 10 so it could sit a bit lower.

the fabric is so beautiful and a bit heavier so it can be worn all year long.
so glad i made this purchase."
"The wide leg was fun, not too wide, but the long pocket seem to shorten leg so i returned. great for a taller person. bottom & trim cute"
"Don't pay attention to the less-than-flattering photo. these jeans are super cute and very flattering. they are actually long, not ankle length as the photo implies. high waisted with a 70s bell bottom vibe. nice light denim for year round wear. they fit like a dream."
"I got this skirt in the dove grey, which is a lovely shade of light grey and silver. it has one layer underneath that is a sparkly silver netting which is really pretty that you can't see in the photo. the other layer is the grey netting. it has a very soft light grey silky cotton liner. i got the petite xs and it fits just as it should. i'm 5'3, 102. the skirt looks just as it is pictured, i think it can be dressy or dressed down a bit. very very pretty and well made. i'm happy with the purchas"
"Really loved this - so soft and snuggly. was unsure about ordering shirt size - (s) or jacket size for layering (m). ordered a small. fits perfect! definitely wouldn't have wanted the medium. 5'4, 135 lbs for reference. love this one!!! great find."
"Love these jeans! they are the perfect relaxed fit; not too baggy, and a straight style. i did size down, because i wanted to wear them as shown. i was afraid that they would ride too low on my hips. glad i did! i usually wear size 29/6 and took a 28 in this pair. the color and denim weight is also great."
I ordered this dress for my daughter. she wore it to a wedding and it was beautiful. looks just as it does in photo. fabric is a nice weight and hangs great. my daughter had her hair done and look right out of an retailer catalog. well made true to size beautiful dress!!!!!!!
"Layered this with a chunky sweater and a pair of kicks. it can be low key or dressed up with a pair of heels, multi-functionality not just occasional. it&#39;s feminine, funky, and fabulous!! i bought the last one in the store!"
"I saw this skirt online and went to the store immediately to try on. i was a bit disappointed. the size is tts but the prints were prettier online. the material is ok. the regular is long so probably won't look good on a shorter person
if it is still available when the price comes down, i might buy it."
"The colors are richer than shown- very vibrant. this piece is very unique and everthing that i love about retailer! i usually wear a medium in jackets and vest. i tried the small and there was very little difference from the small or the medium fit, so i went a size up, just for a looser look. it is very flattering and will be a great addition to my fall wardrobe!"
An interesting design in a high-quality garment.  fits true to size on me and is great for layering.  very soft knit with the drapey attachment and a collar you can adjust to look the way you want. i feel lucky that i got this on sale but i would've gladly paid full price since this is a three season piece.
"I was so excited to receive these jeans. typically, wide leg jeans are a no brainer for me--super flattering and in chambray, i thought, they would be stylish and comfortable. but i found these to be verging on mom jean. something about them seems not so cool. maybe the color of the wash, the weight of the fabric? not sure, but they don't lend themselves to current looks. sadly, i will be sending them back."
"I bought this tee in all 3 colors, and wish there were more!  fabulous quality, material and style.  can dress up or down; wear with jeans, pants or skirts.  wear alone or layer.  don't miss out on this addition to your wardrobe!"
"I'm very short and thus not usually into maxi skirts since most of them make me look frumpy, but i ordered this skirt based upon all the great reviews. this skirt is more amazing in person. at first, the material feels a bit stiff and the gold is a lot more shiny in person. but, as usual, moulinette knows how to put things together. when worn, everything comes together, the pleats and the length flow beautifully and the gold shimmers in a subtle way. the skirt runs large (i'm 34b, 26 waist, 36 h"
"Sits at waist, length is perfect for petite, quality is very good, looks very nice on me, very recommend"
I found these to fit odd. i am also use to wearing the skinny jeans so trying a wide leg was a bit weird anyway. the placement of the pockets and the way it hit my waist was awkward and not flattering. i am usually a 8/10 and the 8 fit but just did not look good.
"Cute jeans! flattering and slimming. tts. the cut of the top makes my butt look flat, but oh well, they are super comfy. they are not as short on me as they look on the model. i'm 5;9"""
"Love it! the pants is absolutely beautiful, rich material, it's not your cheap jogger!
i am really considering buying a second pair just in case i used my a little to much.
fits perfect, i am 5'4"" 114lbs and purchase the regular small."
"I loved this dress and it fit great on me: 5'7, 115 lbs, wore an xs. it was a little tighter than i wish, but the s would have been too loose. unfortunately, when i received the dress the arms were already pilling. it is made of a mix of polyester, and while it's machine washable (yay), i can imagine this dress would be pilling very easily, and i wish the fabric was a higher quality for the price, so i returned it."
This coat is gorgeous but it runs huge! i am typically a s so that is the size i purchased and it was swimming on me. i sadly had to return for an xs so fingers crossed it fits. the coral color is gorgeous and looks nice with my olive skin. very unique coat and as long as the xs fits i will be one happy lady.
Purchased these jeans in a 27 and i am usually a 28 in skinny jeans. i got the 26's on but they were snug. these jeans are so comfy and sit higher on the waist. great jeans!
"I purchased the coral version, and the color is wonderful and vibrant. it fit my daughter beautifully, and she is 5'10"". i think she will be wearing this coat often, she loves it!!! she is 23 years old and has a professional job, so she will look the part."
"I'm in love, i'm in love.

this dress was gifted to me, because i was gawking at it so often. i love it!!! i am petite, 5'3"" 118 pounds and i could do either the small or extra small. the small was a little more comfortable, because the extra small was a bit tight in the arms-but i went with the extra small anyway. in both cases the neckline showed a small amount of tasteful cleavage and i felt like a model with how many people complimented me on it. many people even took the extra step in compl"
The dress arrived with a few snags and the fabric already pilling. the fabric will only get worse with wear. return. cute concept; poor fabric quality.
I love the design and pattern of this top. it runs big so an xs was roomy on me but still cute. the neck is wide. i returned it bc the material of the top isn't for me. the texture is too soft.
"Very comfortable dress, with a gorgeous pattern. it comes with a self liner in navy that is very smoothing - i was worried a figure hugging sweater knit would be unflattering. cut is perfect. i'm a size 10/12 on top and 12/14 on bottom, and the m was the best fit. the neckline is a deep scoop so if you are not busty it may come down too far for comfort."
"I was so excited when this dress went on sale.  it is very soft and the print is so distinctive.  it is super comfy but not slimming or flattering at all.  i am a curvy girl,  wear a medium 8/10 and this made me look so wide!  the skirt is quit full,  a small would have fit but the top was tight.  so disappointing."
This top is stunning. the colors are vivid and it is extremely cozy and soft. however it seems delicate and would need to only be worn once in a while. it is not an everyday top. the material has a cotton candy like appearance. it really is unique and one of a kind.
"I love this skirt. i was happy with the quality of the fabric and style. i originally ordered a small, but returned and exchanged for a medium, which fits great. (i typically wear a size 6-8 in pants). i look forward to wearing this skirt to work this fall."
"After reading the reviews i placed an order because it was the only top that caught my eye on the entire price downs. lately all my usual l/10 sizes from retailer turn out huge so i ordered a size smaller from what i usually wear. all would have been ok if the top wasn't so darn short. for reference i'm 6 ft tall, 160 lb. it's weird that this top looks completely the opposite of the model on the photo, from a loose looking fit with longer sleeves looking like a stylized sweatshirt that is not what"
"Was looking for a replacement coat and saw this lovely. tried on large but was more roomy than needed, even for a coat. tried petite version but found it too short for my taste. decided on medium in green and cannot complain. comfy & stylish. more car coat than main winter coat. have been wearing it daily over light layers so far in our mildish nw winter."
"Another great dress by retailer. i've worn it with tall boots with heels, riding boots and booties...all look really good. i've also added a cream/beige cardigan and even a fuzzy/furry vest. very versatile. the only few things that i would have liked even more is that design of the dress be actual stitching and not just a flat print and also the material does shrink a tat when you wash it. it's a staple and keeper."
"These are both adorable and practical?they're versatile enough to dress up or down, and they are just warm enough for fall temperatures. these will definitely be my go-to tights this season."
Luv these jeans! they felt so comfy the first time i put them on. it's like butter! i'm a 26 but went down a size and wear a belt. they said they r high rise but i can't see how - but no complaints as i can breathe in them :)
"Love this! easy to dress up and down, has a great length on the torso but the sleeves are about 2-3 inches from my wrist bone, i see why the model has them pushed/rolled up- which is how i wear the shirt now too. but then it's hard to layer under a coat."
This is an absolutely gorgeous dress that stands out everywhere i go. it runs true to size and has a slimming effect because of the detail running down the sides.
"5'1'' 43-31-43. i really wanted to love this coat: the material is nice, the green color is dark and rich, it has a hood. however, the cut is bad for me (and probably a lot of other people). the shoulders were cut too wide and impeded movement, and the bust and hips were cut too tight, overall it was just boxy. i have another boiled wool coat that i bought at retailer about 7 years ago and though it's cut oversize like this one, it has a much fuller sweep, so the proportions still seem right. also"
"First, i've been in love with this dress for months. when it went on sale i absolutely had to have it! i'm 5'4"" and 150 pounds and typically wear large stuff from retailer but after reading other reviews i decided to get the medium. it's more generous than i expected and wonder if i could've even gone with a small. i might try a belt. either way i'm very very happy with the dress. the sleeves are not too long - and i didn't get the petite because i wanted the length in the skirt. the lining makes"
"The sweater coat is a must try on! it's a great fall to winter coat, that you can leave on all day if you need. i bought the dark green, which is very dark yet gorgeous and have the beautiful coral saved in my cart as well. i am 5'5"", 135lbs, 34c, ordered the size small and have plenty of room (did not want it tight and wanted to be able to wear over thick layers)."
"Just purchased this coral coat today. the color is beautiful. the quality is excellent and the coat itself is lightweight,great for travel. great purchase and would recommend buying. going to new york and can't wait to wear it . love, love this coat"
"I guess this is a true to size, i am usually a 30dd and ordered 32d, fits great. the back is really pretty, so even though it is a tiny bit looser, i decided to keep it..."
"I tried these on as a return at my store and sadly, they fit great everywhere ecept at the waist. i had almost 2 inches gaping at the waist... my usual size. the rest of the pant was absolutely awesome though. for reference, i tried n a 25 and am 115 lbs and short... bummer htey don't come in petite or 24..."
"Saw this in store in coral color and new i had to try. love. it's the perfect, cozy cute sweater, color is beautiful and fit is great. i am 5 5"" 135 lbs and i tried both the small and extra small. i went with the xs for a more flattering fit. i love it."
"I love the feel and design of this pullover. it is extremely soft and comfy to wear. however, i did find that it runs slightly large, is a bit boxy and the sleeves are a bit lengthy. probably not the best for a petite frame. i am trying to decide if i should keep it though simply for the softness and ease of wearing that it provides."
"I originally got these in a 29 petite and thought they fit great right out of the bag (i'm usually a 6/8).. and within an hour of wearing them (to retailer, actually), the knees had gotten so baggy that they looked absolutely ridiculous; i've never had jeans do this. the salesperson at retailer agreed that they seemed very odd. i exchanged for a 28p at her suggestion, and i just hate them. i'd say the smaller size seems every so slightly small, but nothing major - but the waist actually folds over a"
"I love this as a lounge-at-home top. the colors and pattern are really pretty, it's soft and warm. very comfy and cozy. but it's also boxy and thick so not a flattering cut."
"This skirt is not what i was expecting at all. for starters it runs large, i expected it to sit at the natural waist and it is definitely made to do so, but it was a good two inches too big and therefore wouldn't lay flat and gaped at the front. no bueno. my biggest gripe, though, is that the color looks nothing like it does in the picture. they have it paired with an ivory top and the two look like they match so well but do not be fooled, the background color of this skirt is not even close to"
"I really did not need another coat at all, but i couldn't resist. got it in green - it's dark and woodsy,something robin hood and his merry men could wear in the forest to look and feel their most stylish. the structure is just right - this coat is soft, cozy and fluid, but also tailored enough to wear in a business casual environment... equally well-suited to wear on winter eve dog walks, to a football game, or at the coffee shop for a latte at an outside table. works with most of my wardrobe -"
"I wanted to love these pants, but they were larger than i expected and the fabric is very heavy. almost like a thick sweater."
"It pills a little under the arms and picks up lint, but it's totally worth it. this is a fabulous sweater coat. i receive compliments on it wherever i go. so cozy, warm & delicious. not too hot to wear indoors either. it's breathable. love it. bought in green during black friday sale. highly recommend."
"Omg - wish it came in more colors,,"
"This dress has a beautiful fit; eyed it for awhile--snatched it up at the dress sale! only drawback was the edging around the neck; on some, the cream-patterned fabric was used and it was distracting. hunted around at stores, but ended up getting lucky with online purchase."
Absolutely beautiful. as soon as i saw the color i had to have it. looks great. i am 5 ft 2 in the color is beautiful. excellently made. very comfy. hood is not bulky
Very cheap looking material. looks cheap to cost $158.
I've been a fan of the pilcro chinos for years but the jeans have not been the right fit for me - usually wind up too big in the waist to accommodate the hips. well the em is aptly named as they are made to fit a girl! ! i usually wear a 29 and the 29 fit comfortably and i could probably even go down a size. thank you retailer - please make more in this style!

"What a well-designed dress! the cut is a slight a-line without adding bulk and the pattern is very slimming. the lining makes this a pretty good option for cooler weather. the neck is pretty wide, as others have noted, but i find that a heavy cream colored scarf is a pretty good accent. it does run a little large. i'm 5'5""/130lbs and went with the xsp."
I was initially attracted to the colors
"This coat is a perfect fall to winter transition coat. it is surprisingly warm in 50 degree weather, so i'm sure it will be warm enough in 30-40 degree weather with some added layers. the only thing to note is that it is unlined and the material is soft so it may be prone to pilling. can be worn casually, to work, and dressed up."
"I tried this dress on in the store and ended up ordering it online during the dress sale. it is extremely flattering and really accentuates the waist. it is very comfortable, and made of a nice, soft fabric. i am a 34a and it just barely reveals a tiny bit of cleavage so i don't find the neckline too low. i plan to wear it with tights and booties. i am 5' 4"" and the regular xs comes to a bit below my knees. going to enjoy wearing this lovely dress!"
This is way cuter in person than on model. it is a super soft and fluffy sweater. the colors are so pretty and feminine. i received it as a christmas gift and have already worn it twice. it's perfect with skinny jeans and ugg boots. i vary between xs and small in retailer sweaters. this is a bit boxy so i sized down with the xs and it fits perfect!
"The colors in this dress are much less vibrant in person. the scoop of the neckline is very wide and deep. i know others have posted that this is a great dress for work, but not in my workplace."
"I adore this hooded boiled wool sweatercoat in rich, deep green. quality is great aside from the buttons being sawn on very loosely. it's a great outer layer in the warm northern california fall/winter. i'm wearing it today with a short sleeved boiled wool dress in burgundy for pre-christmas eve cocktails and feeling classy, festive, cozy, and warm."
"Every year i'm excited when the weather gets cool enough for sweater dresses. i love this one, with the longer length, slimming fit and pattern placement, and cozy soft fabric. delightful, inspires reveries of castles and legends (yes i looked up what ""eira"" stands for and went with it). highly recommended. fit is generously tts."
"I adore this sweater coat! i first bought the green color in my normal size online on a whim mostly due to the positive reviews. i was not disappointed at all! this sweater coat is soft boiled wool.. the green color is a deep forest that looks incredible with black, grays and berry colors.

the fit appears to be magical. it manages to be both roomy and figure flattering, which is tricky with my figure (hourglass). i tend to need a defined waist, but somehow this coat manages to be very slimming"
"This sweater dress is lovely, quirky and comfortable. because i have broader shoulders, the neckline was perfect on me, although i probably will end up wearing a scarf to keep my neck warm! the dress skims in a very flattering way. at first i was dissapointed it wasn't more formfitting, but it drapes very nicely. (i usually wear a size four in dresses and chose the small in this dress which was best i think.) it has a built in slip that is a bit flimsy, so i will probably wear a long silk one th"
Cute and comfortable! i loved the colors and how soft the shirt is!
So different than anything in my closet. it's wide with a beautiful drape. fabric is soft but substantial. it has the cutest coral color lining the placket and inside of the lower sleeves. i sized down to a medium and could have gone to a small but i love the length and drape which might not translate in fit in the smaller size. so cute on.
"I really like these jeans, but order a size down. i'm typically a 14 and these were just too big. they stretch as it is and although they should have a baggier fit, they are just too baggie."
"This jacket is worth every penny! it is light enough to wear when like 55/60 out or good when it is in the 40s with a sweater underneath. the fit and design of the coat is amazing! i love the full collar look - that's my favorite detail of the jacket. loved the green so much, i bought the coral too! i normally wear a 12/14 in clothes and the large was perfect!"
"I ordered this coat in the ""pink"" color. actually, it is a coal color (papaya) and will be wonderful with gray, black, khaki, and great with animal print accessories. the fit is just as it looks online, no surprises. this coat is attractive buttoned or unbuttoned. the collar is just as attractive buttoned as unbuttoned. the boiled wool is light weight and has some stretch to it. (much softer than the boiled wool geiger jackets, for anyone who remembers them)

one concern: since the wool is light"
"Here's the thing: this is a sweatercoat. it's not a coat. it's not something i'll be able to wear independently by the end of november, though i'm enjoying doing so now. it's boiled wool, and not lined, and though it's cozy and warm enough for a morning walk to the train in the high 40s, its role is going to end up being a mid layer. i'm also enjoying wearing it over both dresses and pants at work, serving as a kind of cardigan/blazer combination.
i purchased the pink, which i saw online first a"
"Best jeans ever! it's so hard to find a good petite jean. you shop and shiop and then pay $30 more to get them altered. the fit and length on these are perfect. love, love, love!!!"
"I really like the sundry brand. however. this is thin and to me out of character for an retailer tee. it look adorable in picture. however the coloring is way off. the navy is almost black it's so dark and the kaki stripe is a green. it's nothing like i had hoped it would be. fabric in very thin and more like a pajama top. so disappointed. it will go back. i do not make it a habit to bash a product. however with tax, shipping and 83.00 price tag. 103.11 is absolutely terrible."
"This is a comfortable sweater dress, and the quality of the material seems good. the solid blue strip down the front makes it look very bland. i think it would need some dressing up with a necklace or scarf. i decided to pass."
"I ordered this in the orange color from online. they were sold out of petite so i ordered medium (regular). i liked it, but just not flattering. i am 5'2"" and the coat was too big. sleeves were past my hands. i think because i'm ""curvy"" the straight cut of coat would not have looked good on me in a size small. it was a nice coat, just not for me."
"Received these as a christmas gift from my daughter. just wonderful - warm and cozy and cute. size m is just a tad baggy; i'm sure i could have worn small, but no matter. i wear these often and love them! such a treat!"
"Every year around this time, our beloved retailer comes out with a wool sweater coat. i've seen every style over the last five years and this year they have outdone themselves!!! this coat is a dream. not too thin and not too thick...it's the perfect layering piece. the fabric has perfect stretch in it. the colors are lovely (i ended up with the cream color, but i loved the green too!!) in many sweater coats i prefer an xl, but because of the stretch the l was just perfect. i'm 5'8 and it hits wel"
"I tried on this sweater in the store and immediately ordered my size. i got the petite small in natural delivered to my door several days later and am extremely pleased. the fit is roomy enough to layer, but not too large or boxy. the wool is fluffy and luxurious and has terrific appeal. i get compliments every time i wear it...""classic,"" ""fancy,"" ""jackie o."" are all terms i heard used to describe my favorite new sweater. the coat is made from a medium weight wool and is probably not meant for e"
Super soft and comfortable. runs a little large. very cozy.
Wear the collar down & it favors grace kelly. pull it up and it's an oversized hood. this lightweight cozy piece combines everything i love about a sweater & a coat in one.
Warn and super soft. love it !
"Love the high waist, prewashed softness, and relaxed fit. i normally wear a 27 in pilcro but sized down to a 26. for the first time in ages i have a pair of jeans that won's slide down because of the high waistline. i would never tuck anything in so it doesn't matter that it's high waisted but i don't have to worry about them sliding down over my muffin top. worth every penny."
"Nice jeans, but had to return. too tight in hips/thighs and big in waist."
"Im 5'1"" and about 110lbs. ordered the small because i do have some curves- it was huge- more like a large and didnt have much structure at all. the wool was very soft and stretchy. and like others have said- kinda orange- not true coral color. it fit me like a throw blanket- its going back for sure. might purchase again if the petite xs is back in stock and on sale- this should def be under $100."

"I am 5'8 154 pounds and ordered a medium. the coat is a bit bigger than expected and should have gone down a size. i'm keeping this size however because it is incredibly comfortable, roomy and perfect for mild winters. the wool does keep you warm in 50 degree weather."
"I saw this and tried to wait for it to go on sale, but it sold so fast, i wanted the black and i check everyday until they had my size, i love this coat main because of the wait it goes around the neck since i am not a scarf person, this is very cute, im glad i got it, even at the full price."
"These joggers are gorgeous--you can even dress them up! the quality and softness is amazing and very expensive looking. the fit is perfect not to mention the fact that they are very flattering.
really, i knew the minute i saw them, i would love them. but, i do have to say that the lovely model
wearing them ---the model with the wine colored shirt and the awesome red bag (i bought that too!!!)and that big smile sold me!. many thanks to retailer--personal stylists carolyn and blair. always so helpfu"
"I love sweater knit dresses and this the first one i've owned with a flare style that works. pattern placement is gorgeously done and is very slimming in a non-obvious way. i think the fabric is soft and warm. i wish the scoop neckline was a tad bit higher from a modesty standpoint. you may want to size down if you're not busty. i am 5'3"" and m petite was the perfect length on me. shout out to the reno distribution center for getting this amazing dress to me in 1.5 days?!?!?!!!"
"I have this wonderful sweater coat in three sizes (s,sp,m) in the coral, green"
"Oh my goodness! i just received this coat tonight. i love it! it is beautiful and stylish. i got the green which is amazing. i'm 5'2"" - weigh 115. ordered both s and xs. i'm keeping the s - more room in case a heavier sweater. get this! it's a classic! you will smile!"
"I wasn't sure what to expect with these pants. i couldn't figure out from the pictures what the material would actually be like. is it jersey? is it french terry? is it more traditional sweatshirt-type material? nope, turns out, they're like wearing pants made out of a fuzzy, flecked sweater. or like the thickest, loosest sweater-knit tights ever. surprise! they are the strangest pants i've ever owned, for sure, but i actually really like them. they're super comfortable and cozy warm. slightly i"
"This dress hung so nicely on my figure (small up top, bigger in the hips) that i couldn't pass it up. the lines are more flattering in person than in the photos. it might run a little small...i'm normally an extra small, but it was a little snug in the arms. however, the small was too big, so i would suggest sticking with your usual size. the saleslady said would stretch a little. i would have loved to try a petite, but the store didn't carry petite sizes. it will be my go-to holiday dress."
"I coveted this item since i first saw it on instagram. i finally bought it in coral. it's a beautiful coat, the color is lovely and i like the way the hood makes a cute collar when worn down. the only problem is it looks like a bathrobe on me. i am 5'5"" and wear a size 8. i bought a medium, worried a small would not button. the sleeves are far too long. i do not want to go through the trouble of returning, so gave it to my daughter who is four inches taller. it looks cute in her."
Love this as a lightweight coat for cool to cold days. i love the squishy soft feel of the material. it works well with sweaters. love the deep pockets which works with my iphone plus and wallet. i love how simple and practical this coat is. the hood when not used as a hood makes a nice collar for the neck and head.
"I have broader shoulders and thick arms, this dress does an amazing job slimming my arms and not making me appear top heavy!
i'm 5'4 125 lbs, the xs fit perfectly"
"I'll start with saying that it's a beautiful coat- i get tons of compliments and love the color. it runs a little big but it's meant to have to a slouchy, oversized quality to it. my only complaint is that i've had it for about 3 weeks and already one button has completely fallen off and the two inside fasteners already feel loose and very delicate. there's no extra buttons to replace the old one with and i'm worried more of the coat is going to fall apart. super bummed about the construction qu"
This bra is so well made and fits beautifully.
"Snapped this sweet puppy up at my local retailer-in the sale room!!!!! it is beyond fabulous and the coral color is divine!!!! brightens up the drearriest of days-i did size down. i am short and the small sleeves were way too long on my 5ft3in frame. it runs a bit large but if you were to wear a heavier something under it i could see getting your ""normal"" size. the quality is great and the style is just lovely. great jacket-love love love"
Love this coat - great fall piece! i bought the green color and it looks as shown in the picture. great retailer purchase!
I bought it to mainly wear as a coat but i think it'd be great with some leggings and boots as well. if you want a more structured look go a size smaller. i plan on wearing this more as outer wear so i went with large. the coral is beautiful
"This tunic is very nice. flattering, good design, worn in winter and spring, and fits well. i have a curvy figure, and this fits well. i wish it came in more colors.it does show flaws slightly but fits well and is stretchy."
"The top i received was large, really long in length, pockets in the front along the seam, and lots of volume in the back without any princess seams to give it shape. the id #'s matched, but that's about it. returned!"
"At first, i thought this sweater might be too boxy, but fastened at the waist, it's very flattering and the collar is face-framing, and the coral in particular (really more of a mango sorbet shade) is unexpected but cheery for winter.

but the big selling point is the warmth and the giant pockets. brought a new puppy home just after christmas, and this sweater is perfect for layering for late- night trips out with an easy place to stash my phone and treats. bought it in coral and pink."
"I love this sweater! pros: great shape (it's supposed to be a little oversized looking), great color (i have the ivory and it's beautiful), and fits well (the sweater looks boxy until you put it on and it flows in all the right places). the sweater is not soft. that is my only con. it looks so soft in the photos, but the sweater i received is not at all soft and cozy. it is warm. it will be great for the winter - great pair with leggings, skirts or just jeans."
"I love this dress. will be wearing it for the first time tomorrow. it fits well. the neck line is a bit low on me. i think it would look best on someone with more of a chest than i have. i will be wearing a winter white infinity scarf with it (as shown on model). i am 5' 6.5"" and 120 lbs and the small is just right."
"Love this sweater jacket! super comfortable and warm. i am 5'2 and i got a xs petite. it fit perfectly both in length and in the sleeve. the green color is super rich and is perfect for the season. it's easy to wear it up and wear it down. i appreciate that it's not super bulky, which was what i was afraid of. my favorite jacket of the season so far."
"I am 5'6"", 130 lbs with an athletic body type and i ordered a size small. these were really baggy in the thigh/quadricep area and made my thighs look bulky. the fabric quality is very nice and i like the idea of them for curvier body types. my son commented that they looked like pajama pants and i agreed."
"This is a beautiful dress but if you have any hips at all you may find it difficult to find the right size. i usually wear a 0-2 p and found that that the op was too snug on the bottom while the 2p was too loose on top. ( for reference 32-26-35). so if you are perfectly proportioned it could work for you.
also, note that this is a pencil dress....very slim fitting.....probably best suited for a cocktail party."
Purchased this sweater in the blue color which is a gray/blue. it runs large as the xs is still quite roomy on me in the body. although the arms are more snug. great quality.

"I bought this as a birthday gift for my daughter, and i am so glad i did. the colors are beautiful, and the material is so soft. i'm sure she's going to love it!"
"So when i saw a sweater with a big llama face on the front of it, i knew it must be mine. i ordered it and eagerly awaited its arrival. while the llama print and color of the sweater are ah-mazing, the fit of the sweater leaves something to be desired. i'm a 36 dd and mostly a size l, so that's what i ordered. it wasn't snug, but it didn't have the cut to pull off the oversized drapey look, so the areas where it was loose looked...strange. the sleeves were really long too, but i could have rolle"
"I fell in love with this top (sweater) before it could even be ordered - was on model for pants that were available to order. in any case, i later ordered the blue motif online and the colors are even more beautiful in person. the blue also contains fibers of wine - so very pretty. the gray is a soft shade. the quality is lovely too. the only cons are that the seater is rather heavy, but should be great for colder winter months and the zipper on the back is quite conspicuous. however, that said,"
Love the feminine styling of a classic tunic tee! i'll wear it with black leggings this fall. super cute to wear casually or dress up a bit with some jewelry and/or a scarf.
"This top is full of amazing details. the photos really don't do it justice. it is very flowy and does run large but is so pretty and soft and in beautiful shades of blue. i bought a small and it is fairly long in back on my 5'5"" frame but because of the detailing...it just works."
"Unlike the first three reviews, i loved this sweater. the colors were beautiful and i paired it with green cords. i did not find the sweater to be itchy but very comfortable. fits trus to size."
"Great fit even for busty women. ordered an 8 because i usually need the room in the chest area on dresses.(36d-dd) fit nicely without being tight. might have been able to size down but i didn't want to risk being too tight. flattering especially on curves. nice for contemporary office or special occasion. if you like his designs, you won't be disappointed!"
"Love this top, purchased it in the coral color now i'm definitely wanting it in the blue since it is such a great blouse for transitioning into fall. the weight of the top it good since i live in south texas so definitely needing lightweight long sleeves for our weather. i'm sure when the time comes adding a long cardigan or blazer over it as needed for the cooler weather it will look great. fit true to size."
"Absolutely love this suit. the bottoms are very comfortable and covers everything id like it to. it does not ride up at all, which almost never happens with swim suits. i'm going to order this in a different color next season. i paired the bottoms with the peplum top and received many compliments."
I just love this dress.  took me ordering a number of sizes- petite and regular to find the best fit.  i might still have the top altered.  i received a lot of compliements.  work it with some black leather wedges for daytime/work.
"I got the purple color and absolutely love it. i am 5'2"" but decided against the petite size and i wanted it to be a bit longer. i also went with the xxs as the xs was a bit too loose on the arm. it was definitely a splurge to buy the sweater but it looked so lovely!"
Love the color! very soft. unique look. can't wait to wear it this fall
"I got the rooster version and the colors are simply gorgeous.  i'm not so much into wearing a farm animal image, but the colors are just too striking to pass this up. the sweater is tts, but with a slightly baggy fit. i did not find it scratchy."
"Really cute and very comfortable. material is thin and sheer. i wear tanks under things anyway, but especially in pink, you would need to. but love the style."
"I love this sweater.  i am 5' 1"" and tried on the petite in the store but ended up going with the regular size as i preferred the length.  the overall fit was the same.  i bought the blue which to me is the colour shown here, more a grey and purplish colour, beautiful for fall and much nicer than a straight blue.  i have worn it to work several times and always get a compliment.  this sweater is nice for all ages, it is soft, comfortable and versatile.  it might just be my go to fall sweater."

"I ordered this in a small petite and medium petite , and i am a huge fan of a*k. i put tried on the sp. while it fit, it was very long, even for a petite. what i hated about it was that the piping on the top made me look very wide. even a long necklace wouldn't help deter the look. on a positive side, the blue was a very nice, cool color. i am usually a small to medium in a*k (6-8 in tops) and the small fit well in the arms/bodice, just too much fabric for me. returning!"
I have the blue color of this top and i love the color variation throughout. it looks very unique and it is going to be a great piece for late summer/early fall. the pleated look on the upper chest is very flattering and adds texture to the top. i am pleased with my purchase!
This sweater is perfect for transitioning into fall as it is not too heavy. it's flattering and looks great with jeans.
"I'm an xl but ended up buying this in a size large. i am very pleased with the interesting cable pattern that runs down the front. i also really like that this is cotton, and even though it is heavy and substantial, the thread gauge is a fine weight. while this says i can hand wash the sweater, i'm reluctant to because i'm worried that hand washing will end up stretching the sweater out of shape. i don't care for the heavy gold zipper running down from the neck, but my hair hides that. overall,"
"Bought this is the blue, which is actually a very grey-blue.  i love cotton sweaters and they are not easy to find.  this one has lovely colors and unusual design, but is a bit too full.  that said, i am keeping it for the cotton/linen factor, alone."
"My perspective is as a sewer so i'm more picky perhaps. this top is poorly made. the fabric pattern is crooked or not consistent in each piece. sewers do this to save $ - squeezing the pieces on the fabric. it looks sloppy. the cut is very full; the bottom edge measures 104"" around. for my figure, curvey, at 5'6"" and 150lbs, this top is not flattering it looks maternity. perhaps best on a slim figure and with leggings."
"I love mixed media clothing, and this is no exception. i fell in love with this right away, and after being torn between the two colors, opted for the rose. it's very gorgeous in person - midweight and very soft. however, as soon as i put it on, i noticed the knit sides truly flare out; they don't lay nicely like on the model. it could be because of my large chest (36dddd), but everything below the chest seems to widen me. it might work better on someone with a straighter build or smaller chest."
"I've been looking for some new, casual tops and ordered this one for the sky blue color. i'm a size 6 and the small fits great. i don't find the blowzy style overwhelming. i am small boned but i'm 5'8"", not a petite. i like it with leggings and skinny jeans ...a nice proportion. however, i can see how this cut may be too much on someone with a smaller frame. i really like it, however i see two drawbacks: the material is a bit thin for fall and it wrinkles very easily (not good for travel). this"
"I got the pink version to layer with spring clothes. i always wear a medium, but sized down to a small based on the other review. the seams are very flattering. the material is very soft. on sale, the price is reasonable."
"I love this tee but there is a lot of swing/ fabric so it can tend to make you look wide. also, i have a short torso to begin with but this tee is on the short side. i'm still undecided on whether i'm going to keep it b/c it's rayon/ poly and it's hand wash only. and i'm worried that one wash will make it shrink in length and it's already short. rayon knits have a tendency to shrink in length when washed so beware!"
"This top reminded me of a maternity top. cute, but better suited for someone smaller chested."
I love this shirt so much i am ordering the coral too! the weight of the material makes it hang nicely. there is a lot of material but it lends itself to the flowy style. i got many compliments of this top!
"This sweater is perfect! finally a sweater that doesn't make me look like a huge box!

i bought the blue & it has other colors running through it so i'll be able to wear it with chinos & jeans. very pretty, flattering & i think i'm going to be wearing this a lot."
"I love byron lars. very taken with his fabrics and design concepts and i have ordered several of his dresses but i believe i need to surrender to the fact that they do not work for my body type. the dress is gorgeous in person: all the fabrics are great, the dress is fully lined and lots of nice finishing touches. it is a unique and very striking dress; this one i really wanted. however, it is designed for a woman who is proportionally longer, leaner with a larger bust size than i have. i ordere"
"Wanted to love this sweater for its beautiful colors and cute graphic, but the fit is uncomfortably small and it is so itchy i was yelling, ""get it off"" in the fitting room. bummer."
"True to size for petite person; bought in blue - subtle shading, looks great; paired with your blue straight leg blue ""jeans""; perfect outfit for almost all occasions."
"This is a beautiful sweater with deep rich colors. i purchased the blue motif. the problem is that the model(s) are small busted, which allows the side panels and front panel to lay nicely and swing in a flattering manner. i am 5'6'', 135 pounds and a 36d. i usually wear a small in antro tops. i purchased this online, and was excited upon it's arrival. when i tried it on, i was horrified. it looked like a babydoll maternity sweater on me. the front did not lay well (flat) at all from the chest d"
"Spotted this beauty in my local store - hanging (grrr) which made it stretch out. note that it's made of linen, cotton, and acrylic, so it's not heavy, it's weighty. anyways, it seemed to run large just due to gravity, so i ended up ordering it so it wasn't all stretched out. it's got a beautiful a-line cut - perfect for us bottom-heavy gals. love the colored thread woven throughout. worth the extra $."
Okay this shirt is soooo comf. it is super fun and flowy. but it runs large. get one size smaller than you would usually get! so worth the sale price!!!
Cute and comfy shirt! tts- got my usual m (i'm a 10) and it has a generous fit but i think it's supposed to. it's actually a silver grey color.
"I would highly recommend this top. i usually wear a small petite. but returned the top for an xs petite which fit perfectly. there is a lot of fabric, but if you size down it wasn't an issue for me. i weigh 120lbs and am 5 feet tall. also, i'm busty, 34 d. which worried me with this type of top. not a problem. i will wear a blazer or leather short jacket with this. i am very picky and i was happy with the quality. the fabric is not heavy. it's a fantastic purchase!"
"I loved this but hesitated to order since i'm petite and busty and assumed it would be an awful mess in the chest area (too tight, gaping etc) but it is great!!! it fits perfectly! there is plenty of room in the chest and the dress is not too long! i ordered a pm and its wonderful. the dress is not see through at all. love it!!!!!"
Runs a little big. fabric is very soft and comfortable
"This top is really cute and i think will be a great transition piece. i'm glad i tried it on in the store as it runs very small. i typically wear a 00 or 0 and bought this in a 2. they didn't have it in stock,so i ordered it and hope it fits."
"I just saw this vintage style blouse at my local store and tried it and think this blouse is amazingly beautiful! it's actually very well made and a tad heftier than i imagined from the picture. there's different strips of gorgeous lace all over including that amazing lace at the collar and bib, the arm holes are just perfect in my regular size small (34d-27-35) so it runs tts and i didn't find this overly blousy myself though that's just part of its charm. you'll need an undershirt or something"
Beautiful dress but have to return. way too big & long for me. medium is the size i wear but i think i would need an extra small.
"I love this top. the quality is excellent. the blouse is lined and falls nicely.. i like to wear it with a pair of dark gray jeans. the color is described as ""orange"", but it really has more of a bronze tone. looks very rich and exotic. it's perfect top when you want to wear jeans, but want to dress it up a bit."
"This swimsuit completely exceeded my expectations! 
i'm 5'2"", 140 lbs with an athletic build, and the cut of this swimsuit is ultra slimming! with the way the top wraps it makes my torso look much longer and leaner than it actually is :) i bought the top in a small and the matching bottoms in medium. 

the material is thick, high quality, and the colors are exactly the way they appear online. 
the top is reversible and the alternate side is teal and nude. i feel like i got 4 tops in one sinc"
"I'm 5'2 around 125 lbs, muscular and petite, so i ordered a petite small and it fits great. the length is perfect, i can wear with heels or dress down with flops. it's lined, which i think most dresses and skirts should be, so i was happy about that. i was pleasantly surprised with the slits up both sides, to show a little leg....sexy. it's not too low cut that you have to wear a cami and ruin the neckline, so that's plus. my only issue was the fabric didn't line up on me the same as the model,"
"As soon as i saw this dress, i knew i had to have it. i just tried it on and it is beautiful. i feel gorgeous and glamorous! i can't wait to wear this to a special event as it truly deserves that attention.

the silk is soft and the slip underneath is perfect. the tie in the back perfectly cinches the dress and the pleating is a wonderful detail to the look.

i am 5'0"", 110, and i purchased the small petite. it's slightly big around the armholes and it kind of poofs / puckers out so i'm going to"
"This top was quite voluminous when i purchased it and i sized down to an xs, however after hand washing it once in cold water it has shrunk significantly. it still fits, but something to be aware of."
"I agree with the other reviewers that this runs big. unfortunately there is nothing smaller than an xs so this is going back. i love the lyocell material, i have another skirt with this material and wanted to love this as well but it is too big and with the drawstring pulled tight to fit it doesn't look right. it is not as pictured as well. the skirt i received is a medium blue denim, not the lovely light blue as pictured, another reason why i am returning."
"I love how soft and cozy this sweater is. the addition of some cashmere in the yarn makes all the difference. the red color is beautiful also, perfect for the holidays. flattering cut in the back (it dips down to cover your bum) and the pointelle details are very pretty. fit was tts"
This top is such a great investment piece. looks classy and is comfortable all at the same time. it is pricey but you will not regret buying this. goes great with light trouser denim or i have the green pilcro khakis. it will he something you will keep in your closet for a long time.
"I always end up walking out of an retailer store with something very different than what i thought and this was one. it drapes beautifully and the red color is rich and vibrant, cool tone not orangey. i fell in love with this one in person. it jumped at me in the store, but online i think the outfit that the model is wearing is not my style at all and does not do the item justice. if you like to cover your assets, you will love it."
"This is a very comfortable, good-looking skirt. fits as shown. the zipper however is rather short, and it takes a bit of squirming to get it over the hips. once on, it's great.  it is not made in the usa, as stated. it is clearly marked ""made in mexico"" from ""globally sourced"" materials (i.e. not from the us)."
"I live in south florida so i'm always looking for sundresses that will be flattering (but not too clingy or hot), and that i can take from day to evening with accessories. when i pulled this out of the box and walked around in it, it met all my criteria, and as an added bonus, my husband said, ""wow! you look great! where'd you get that dress?"" i'm shocked because as an earlier reviewer said, this dress doesn't seem like much - it's not even lined. but it's comfy, flattering (in all the right pla"
"I agree, this dress runs long, but since i love high heels, it falls just right for me. it does seem quite roomy for a medium, which is a pleasant surprise. the fabric, drape and quality are contemporary but i know i'll be wearing this beyond this year for sure."
Pretty pink top is great for layering iand alone in the summer and spring
"This shirt fits very true to size, with very soft and comfortable material that hangs just right. wears well and is versatile for many occasions. please come out with more colors so i can purchase them as well!"
"I bought this in both the taupe and ivory. the beading on the neck line, the tie at the neck and the pleats make this a fun shirt. i bought a size 2 which is normally what i wear at retailer, so i would say it is true to size. i really like the length of the top. it hits mid-hip on me. it is a tad shorter on the sides than i would like but it is still long enough to cover my waistline. i also think the arms are too long so there is kind of a balloon look at my wrists because of it. i bought it to"
"I saw this dress on line and knew i wanted it for the spring/summer season. i ordered it almost immediately and i am so glad i did. the photo on the website doesn't do it justice, there are a lot of pretty pastel colors in the paisley pattern that you just can't see on the computer screen. the wrap styling is a very flattering cut for most figures especially hourglass figures like mine and the dress fit's tts (for reference i am 5'9"" and a 36ddd). the silk material is very light and flowy and wi"
"I was really looking forward to receiving this blouse in the mail. the color was beautiful in person and the photo does not show the nice beading around the neck. that being said, i was so disappointed in the fit. i ordered a size 00 and the arm length was way too long yet the body of the shirt was way too cropped. cropped enough where you could see skin on the sides. made no sense! hoping to order a few more sizes to see if i can find the right fit. order up for length, down for arm length ..."
"A little shorter than expected. very billowy, so watch out for wind!
it fits well on the arms and shoulders. not too see through"
"I order this shirt because it looked like a shirt you could dress up or down. when i got it the shirt was really wrinkled. therefore, i knew it would have to ironed a lot. it was quite boxy and was shorter in the front then in the back. i didn't realize that this shirt was two different fabrics. overall i think this shirt would be more flattering on a woman that was petite."
Great that it's hand washable because i hate the smell of dry cleaned garmets.
Top is very wide and flowy. i am petite with large chest so it hung from widest point and was not flattering. would be very cute with the right body shape.
I want to the store to try this skirt on. that had only one size m in stock (my size) and it was huge! i ordered an xs and it fits nicely. it's just what i needed for the warm days ahead.
"After the reviews about sizing, i ordered the size 16 (am normally size large). interestingly, the tag on the blouse says it's a 14. with all that said, the blouse is cute enough and sizing up gave me enough length (in spite of the higher sides) that i'm considering keeping it. although it's a bit big, it flows nicely and isn't oversized in that wide, crazy way. the sleeves are a bit too big but they're cuffed with a button and can be rolled. the fabric is somewhat crinkled in texture. i got the"
"I love the style and quality of this blouse. it can easily be dressed up or down. the blouse is completely see through and delicate. still, it is so romantic, feminine, distinctive and timeless."
Comfortable and great fit and color. high quality.
I loved this blouse when i got it and wore it before washing. it fit really well and was flattering. the only time i laundered it i hand- washed it in cold water and hung it to dry. the blouse shrunk at least a full size and in awkward places. the sleeves are now tight and way too short. the overall length shortened by at least 2 inches. the top is so tight in the bust now that the buttons popped open. i'm very disappointed and surprised.i will be returning it as it is unwearable as is.
"This bunches up too much, and the fabric is even more see through than i expected (so even with a tank top under it, it's not a good look for work). even unbuttoned at the top, i could barely get this over my head!  this one is going back."
"I haven't worn a halter dress in ages and saw this one and wanted to get it, hoping that it'll fit me. 

i love the swing skirt and the halter. this dress can be easily dressed up or down depending on your mood. there is a side zipper. 

i got s p and it hits me exactly like the dress on the model. it is unlined but with the color of the dress, i don't mind it."
"I agree with the other review that the dress runs big and long, but i love it! it's very flattering and i have super high wedges that work great with it. i don't think it runs ""super big"" but it's slightly big. definitely size down if small busted. i wore it out and got a ton of compliments. it's classy, different and hot!"
"Bought this blouse to wear with high wasted jeans and pants. it lays beautifully and can be dressed up or down. it's somewhat sheer, but i don't plan on wearing a cami under it. perfect for work or going out."
"I definitely recommend this shirt. it's lights and airy, something you can wear everyday."
"Love the way this top layers under my jackets and sweaters! so romantic and pretty. i am not experiencing the over pouf at the waist that a previous reviewer complained about. the fabric is slightly itchy and the top shipped to my house has misshapen shoulder bumps from the store hanger. all the beautiful styling pics done by retailer employees on ig is what made me want this blouse. whatever is going on with the model shot really really really does not represent how cute this top looks. in fact,"
"There is no way this is worth the price. i was deeply disappointed when it arrived. the material is thin and feels cheap. i love the design, and anna sui, but this is just so overpriced."
Beautiful victorian look blouse. runs large and overly blousy on me.
This top is really cute and true to size. i like the color and the nice details.
"I'm 5' 0"" and 120 pounds. this top is beautiful. it's high neck is so flattering. a nice switch it up for us gals that are older and like neck coverage sometimes. i purchased a small and it is a little longer, but since it has elastic at the waist it's no problem. i will tuck it in my jeans and skirts. the arm holes are perfect. the as far as it being a lot of blouse, i didn't find that at all. but i am busty, 34c or d depending on brand of bra. the color is ivory. omits completely sheer, no lin"
"Tried this blouse on in the store and fell in love with this top. i went down one size since i am a true petite. they were sold out of the petite small, but the regular x-small fit perfect. it is a little short so it's perfect for shorter people,"
Oh yes. another sequin top to add to my collection. it is sparkly without being glittery- if you know what i mean. can definitely dress down as it is tee shirt- like. lots of options for this one. tts.  much better in person than the online pics.
"Unfortunately i had to size down twice with there pants. great feel, they're soft and the grey is a soft color."
"The fabric is so beautiful that i am tempted to buy in a large size and have re-made. the waist is tiny. the hips are wide. when it goes to half price, i may be tempted to take it to my favorite alterations lady. the fabric is that exceptionally beautiful."
"These joggers are soo cute. they fit great!!
i seriously love them!! i have worn them so often
i may have to ban myself from them for a week.
i am 5'4 and the length was perfect for a jogger pant.
i got an xs because the small looked too baggy. 
the xs loosened up a little after wearing them and are perfect."
"If i could sew, i'd take the fabric from this skirt and make it into a different shape (after ordering a bigger size). the fabric is just as it appears online -- totally gorgeous with almost a quilted feel to it. however, this thickness means the skirt sticks out like something judy jetson would wear. it's also too small in my go-to skirt size (and i order a lot at retailer). the waist and hips are small (making the skirt too short as well), but the bottom flares out ridiculously. i ordered two of"
"I bought these in the olive green, in the store and will be ordering the gray pair online. i am 5' 9"" and 145 lbs, long legs and these are beyond adorable. some people mentioned that they stretched out? i did not find this to be true. what i do know is they can be dressed up or dressed down. they are flattering and perfect for the spring/summer. i would highly recommend and would/will purchase in every color. well done retailer!! one of my most favorite purchases so far this spring."
"I love the flower patterns. they add feminine touch. this legging is well made with good quality spandex. the only cons is the color is not as deep as the picture. when you wearing it and the fabric stretched, the color looks much lighter. other than that, it's a good buy!"
"This top is gorgeous in both detail in color. it fit great and true to size, but then i hand washed it as instructed on the label and it shrank substantially to the point that it's now too short and needs to be returned."
"I ordered these as i was curious of hte fit on my body type (shorter, thighs)... well, it was ok, but in the end, i dind't keep them as i would be better off wearing jeans on casual day, or ""real"" joggers (as in jogging material).

cut was ok, not super flattering, but tapered pants only suit stright legs in my opinion.

material was nice enough, din'dt notice wrikling, but i didn't wwear them, jsut tried them on.
grey color was nice."
I loved the color and design of this dress but needed to return it because it fit so poorly. the arm holes are entirely too big -- so big that alternations couldn't fix it. maybe it's because i am petite but i think it may be a design flaw.
"Got the black but the orange it very pretty too the black fabric has a sheen to it; almost like snakeskin. as other reviewers have mentioned, it does run small and the armholes are cut in a bit. overall it is a more interesting than a basic lbd."
"The print on these leggings is so cool but they are completely see-through. i mean seriously, seriously see-through."
"Was so excited for this top! loved the embroidered detail and the teal green color. i got it in a medium and it was swimming on me. it also had a maternity type feel since there is a lot more material (making it look blousy) than showing on the model (they must have pinned it back in the stock photo).
sadly, it's going back."
I was so impressed with the style & boning on the sides for the perfect fit! it's truly a classic staple in your closet for that lbd!!
"I was surprised how soft and comfy the fabric is on this top. when i tried it on, i didn't want to take it off! it's a little bigger than i would like - i got a small, and am usually between xs and s. may have sized down if the top were available.but the fit and cut are flattering."
I usually wear a size 8/10 and i needed a large in this skirt. it flows so beautifully!
"I love this little number. the quality is terrific, the weight is perfect, and the cut is superb. i love the way it fits and looks in the arms. i ordered my usual xxsp and it is perfect. i like that it is cool and flowy, without looking like maternity attire. i have the bright turquoise and i am going to order another. i was about to order what looks like a yellow one, but i noticed the color is labeled ""chartreuse"". can anyone tell me if this is more yellow or green in ""real life""?"
One of 3 pair of leggings ordered and the only pair to fit properly! size l was perfect for me. they stretched nicely going on and the beautiful floral design on the legs didn't get distorted or faded looking from the stretch. wearing these makes me happy :)
"These leggings are beautiful! so unusual and colorful, comfortable, and flattering. they fit true-to-size with enough stretch to move with you yet retain their shape. the fabric is a bit lighter-weight than ponte but heavy enough to be completely opaque. i would definitely recommend these beautiful leggings to anyone who doesn't mind attracting a little (envious?) attention."
"I totally love this tank! the yoke detailing is so pretty! i read the other reviews...i feel it fits pretty tts, it's what i expected. i have already worn it several times since it arrived in the mail. i love it so much, i'm ordering it in the turquoise color as well. every time i have worn it, i have received compliments. i've worn it alone with shorts and/or jeans, as well as with a cardigan and dress pants for work. it's soft, comfortable and to echo what another review stated, the material s"
Gorgeous cobalt blue color!!!  usually s/m- bought the small (because of larger armholes).  so glad i snatched this one up on sale!  the detail on the top is amazing.
"I like the idea of the pullover. the quality of is nice; the material is very soft and feels pleasant to the touch.

i expected this sweater to be more flattering though. it is true to size, but the length is strange. it seems a bit too long, yet is too short to look like a longer tunic. or maybe the waistline is a little low... whatever it is, it makes me look like i have short legs.

also, the collar won't stay down, the way it is shown in the picture. but it may work better for someone wi"
This dress is attractive but it runs a little small. i'm a small curvy girl who usually wears a 2. this was small in the top and short waisted. i wanted to wear it to a recent event and didn't have time to return it for another size.
"These leggings were way longer and darker then appeared on model. 
they also were see through or beige color when stretched across hip.
especially for the high cost, there are much better althleisure leggings on the market."
"A lovely skirt and i'm so glad i found it before the medium sold out! having said that, i expected the medium to run small and that i'd have to squeeze into it but having tried it on this evening it's not the case at all. i nice fit. i might even have fitted into a small, which i think is the only size remaining. the skirt is very spain inspired. very flamenco! i love it! i will say that you'd need a bit of height to wear this skirt due to the length at the back. i'm 5'6"" which is tall enough fo"
"First, the good parts: these are adorable in person and (i think) the colors are prettier in person than in the pictures. the green isn't too army green, it's a pretty nice mellow neutral that you could wear with reds, whites, blues, pinks...virtually any color.

the tencel fabric is super soft and comfortable and the drape is nice. they do seem to run a little large, so i'd size down if you're between sizes.

and now, sadly, the bad: these stretch out virtually an entire size after just about a"
"I adore these little joggers. i was immediately drawn to the color (army green) and the little details. i carry all my weight on bottom, so i don't often wear many retailer bottoms (i'm usually a 16). i tried the xl on just to see how they would work and i was pleasantly surprised! they are absolutely perfect. they fit a little baggy, as joggers do, and go with just about everything! mine did loosen a tad, but not like the previous reviewer. i highly recommend these! can't wait to wear these throu"
Love this tank. it has an easy fit that hides my post baby belly with out looking to wide.
"I love this blouse. the lace panels are slightly sheer, but nothing inappropriate. the solid fabric is a lovely sort of heavy crepe. stunning bright cobalt blue color. i'm an xl in retailer and this top fit well in xl; ever so slightly snug at one part on the sleeve but nothing noticeable or uncomfortable. be aware, this did bleed blue when it was soaking and it did drip blue water while it was air drying on the hanger. while this blouse is still wet i would stretch out the sides and sleeves to ge"
"This is a beautiful fabric and the skirt is so nice. what is wrong is the cut of the skirt. one side bells out more than the other, giving it an off center look from the front. my legs were not centered."
"I so wanted to love this dress! the fabric is gorgeous the styling beautiful and the construction is great - however, the armholes are cut too generously. i am 5'4"", 138 pounds and 36d. i ordered the black in a size 10. it fit me perfectly everywhere but the armholes. even with an undergarment, too much is exposed. i am sadly returning this."
"Hei hei is my favorite line. i am a medium in all of the pants i have ever purchased from this brand.
i ordered these in the green and they arrived today. they fit me as if they were an xxl. i have a similar pair in rust from last summer so i assumed that they would be the same. 
obviously they are going back tomorrow . i'm very disappointed, they are a nice looking jogger and the color is pretty."
"First of all, the label on this dress is maeve, not nue by shani. second, i just wasn't impressed. the fabric is cool...it has a sort of embossed look to it and it's somewhat shiny, which sets it apart in a good way. but the cut is just boring. the top felt dowdy to me...overall, i was underwhelmed by this dress and returned it."
"I was really wanting a nice white summer blouse to pair with patterned skirts. unfortunately, this fell short as it was huge. not only was it big, it flared at the bottom. it would be perfect if i was sporting a baby bump, but not what i am going for right now. if the tank was a bit slimmer i would have kept it as a tunic.i'm sad that i'll have to return it."
"I wanted a casual, denim colored skirt for warmer weather without the denim weight  and this skirt fit my needs perfectly.  i'm 5'4, 117lbs and the xs fits me true to size, hitting about 1 1/2 inches above the knee. it's a more modest length for daytime but it definitely needs a slip underneath. the raw edge is subtle (no hanging threads) and unique. i can't speak to the lack of colorfastness but i washed it separately and will be mindful of the possibility ."
"I love this top!! the detail on front top of the top is so cute. the length is just right. i hesitated because of the unusual armhole shape but they are really not an issue. also, thanks for finding the top as it wasn't available at distribution center, went of your way!!"
"These leggings are beautiful and different. the material is very stretchy, sort of a spandex feel. panty lines definitely show in the back. i found they run true to size; i wear a size 6/medium/28 in pants or jeans and the size medium fit me great."
"L space is frustrating. i wear a 0/2 top but with 32d's i tried a large in this bikini top because from past experience with l space they run small. there's just zero support. the tie design helps secure the girls in place, but also flattens them out if you tie it tight enough so you don't spill out."
"I just purchased this tank in white and blue. i find it to be soft and will be perfect for hot days but also can wear into the fall with a cardigan. it's super comfy but i do find at retailer that it's best to try things on in the store (it's hard to find perfect sizes online since things are cut so differently based on the designer). i got a large and though it's a bit flowy in the tummy area, it fits nicely across my chest (not tight)."
These were a little baggier than expected and the petite size ran long.
Great lightweight summer top that's bra friendly.  i bought the teal color yesterday and wore it today with white skinnies.    i'm sometimes a small and sometimes a medium and was fine with the small on this one
"I love love this top. i was on the fence about it since it runs large and is loose fitting, very loose. i tried m, l, and xl. i usually wear xl but bought an l in this. i tried m, it was loose around the mid-section but fitted at the top. i wore them with fitted skinny pants and the top looks amazing. perfect for summer. the armholes also look flattering - not too big. i like turquoise. i didn't find yellow in the store, so bought green and white. it does need some ironing."
"This pants look pretty much exactly like the picture except these will wrinkle really easily so there is no way they will ever appear as wrinkle free as the pic.

i found the color to be exactly as seen online so i am not sure why others didn't. the material is really light weight so i think these will work well for spring.

overall cute especially for the price. if not on sale, i would not have bought them but the sale price makes these pants awesome."
"This is not something i would normal wear but the beauty of the fabric made just give it a try. i am so glad i did. the fit is beautiful slimming feminine fit with just enough flow. i love it and bought it right away. you better get it before it's gone. also it is true to size, i have along torso so sometimes i have issues with jumpers but not this one."
"These undergarments are comfortable, streamlined, and well made. this bra holds up well without wires. i am a 34b and wear a small. it is a bit tight at first, but form fits after one wear. . after trying one bra and i ordered 4 more. then i researched the brand and bought camis to match. i love how all the colors and styles are interchangeable."
"I tried this jumpsuit on in the store and loved it but decided to wait on purchasing it. after it went on sale i jumped on it because i new i would regret not buying it. 

i am tall but most of my height is from my long legs, not in my torso. i seldom find jumpsuits that fit my frame but his one fits perfectly. the fabric is very ""flowey"" and does not wrinkle. the overall design of this jumpsuit is slightly but not overly baggy. the pattern and pleating make it a perfect item for spring and su"
I fell in love with this dress the instant i saw it. but was disappointed when i received it. first was the color. i chose the green and it wasn't what i thought. it was a very unnatural shade of artificial grass. when my husband saw it in the package he thought i had ordered a cheap grass hula skirt. the color was that bad. the fit was the next problem. this dress would have fit nicely if they had just added a side zip and made the top more fitted. the top was loose and that added to the flowy
"I love this jumpsuit and definitely feel too confident in it! the fabric is a great weight- flowy, but still substantial enough. with nude undergarments, i can't see anything. in fact, that is one of the things i love; no special undergarments are required, so it is very comfortable and still very flattering. i typically wear a medium- 135 pounds, 5'4"", 34b, 28 waist, 40 hip. i tried the small after seeing some reviews that it ran big. i would have bought it, but the salesperson suggested i try"
"Runs large in arm holes. have to wear bandeau. love this print and flow of dress. loose but still flattering due to arms and shoulders . love the overall look. midi length for this 5'6.5"" gal. size s worked best -36c-125lbs"
"I was so excited to splurge on a mara hoffman suit and was sorely disappointed when i received this suit in the mail. i'm petite and fairly curvy, so i knew it would likely be a little long in the torso but the whole suit was so oddly shaped, i couldn't imagine anyone it would fit. the square shape in between the halter pieces is awkward, and the pieces that are supposed to hold your chest are super wide and loose."
"I love this dress. it is so soft and comfortable, perfect for summer!! i wish it came in more colors because i would buy everyone!!"
"Like other reviewers, i'm glad i sized down. this is a cute tunic that is definitely great quality, lightweight chambray. i love that it has pockets, but they do puff a bit at my hips."
"This is the perfect bralette for comfort; it's soft and fits to form really quickly. i wear a b cup, and it's enough support for me to wear daily doing everything other than heavy exercise. now, at 5 months pregnant it's pretty much perfect to sleep in too. i'm at 35 band, and i'm still wearing it on the loosest closure, but it fits perfectly there for me."
"I really wanted this. they had two size small in my local retailer, both were damaged. so disappointing. i don't want to pay shipping for one that hopefully isn't damaged:( in the last year i've had multiple quality control issues with retailer. makes me gun shy. not sure i'm getting what i pay for anymore."
"I followed the advice of other reviewers and sized down from a s to xs. i was worried about the length of the torso since i'm long in that area, but the xs still worked great. it's a totally adorable jumpsuit with a nice fit. my biggest peeve with this was that it came dirty on the hems...like it had been dragged on the ground somewhere. unfortunately, there were no more xs online once i got it though, so i will keep and try to clean. this is not the first time in recent months that i have recei"
"This dress looks better in person. nice navy with subtle pattern - looks super cute with a really lightweat pale yellow sweater! i thought that wiastband area would hit in a funky spot (my problem area) but it doesnt and looks great. super comfortable and i love this neckline. also has a decent lining so no bra necessary if youre cool with that. i have packed on some ""after 50"" lbs and wear a 12-14 shirt and 10-12 pant and the large is roomy enough.i received a number of compliments and let's fa"
I received this dress as a gift and it has become such a great addition to my wardrobe! i love that i can wear it to work and then out with friends. a great value if you're looking for one special piece that you can get miles out of - you can wear the two pieces separate or together. i love floral and felt this non traditional take on a floral was very refreshing.
"This would be perfect if only it were lined!!!! i have a high waist and hourglass shape so jumpers are very hard to find that fit my body type. this is a perfect fit for my body shape and when on, it looks like a lovely dress. however, it is not lined and the material is very light and ivory so you see everything. you can't wear a slip so that leaves the option of some sort of bodysuit if you don't want to show the world what you have. i am very tired of all of the light colored clothing not bei"
"Simply awesome. wonderful fit and flatters any body type. looks great booties, flats, or flip flops. must have ..."
"Although it may not look like it takes on a shape - what a wonderfully flattering jumper. was intrigued from seeing it in the catalog and had to try it on in the store -- i was unsure how the middle would appear. but it fit, wonderfully feminine, looking forward to the summer."
"I had been eyeing these for a while, but as they didn't seem very popular, i figured i'd wait for a sale. i finally bought them at the 40% off of sale price (yay!) and i love them. they're extremely comfortable, and very flattering. i'd say they run true to size, but maybe on the smaller end of the size for the waist. the blue pants are more greenish in color than the picture shows, but still beautiful. i'm looking forward to wearing these now and into the spring."
I loooove this. my favorite retailer purchase in a while and i buy frequently. ran out of s p while in my basket (there are never enough petites available) so i got the medium. it is big but with this style i can pull it off. it does run a bit large so a s would have been perfect. please make this in more colors/fabrics! i would buy them all!
Easy and fun jumper. runs slightly large. i ordered a medium and returned for a small. can be dressed up or down for a variety of occasions. would be perfect if it had pockets.
This is such a pretty dress. light and flowy. i got it to wear on hot summer days.
"I loved this jumpsuit. it fit well on my curvier/athletic frame. i did prefer a belt, which emphasized my shape. unfortunately, it is not lined and a bit sheer. this was a deal breaker for me."
"I have been dying to try a mara hoffman bathing suit, so i went for this one. unfortunately, the design of the bathing suit is not like what they sent me. the middle where the tops meets the bottom, is squared off, not like that v that it looks like in this photo. it also makes for major side boob/sagging on each side. i was very disappointed."
"This dress was pretty but had a weird fit. the waist droops down in the middle instead of going straight across, which i found unflattering. i ended up returning it."
"I was unsure about this dress when i first tried it on. the color is gorgeous, it is flowy and beautiful. it hits just below the knee (i am tall), which is something i am not used to. i hadn't decided on it, but my husband loves it and that's all that matters! it is very feminine and pretty. i normally wear a 0, but ordered a 00- it fits just slightly loose, which is the style this dress is going for."
I love these pants. i have them in navy and carbon. the navy color seems to run bigger than the carbon. they are very loose like a boyfriend pant in navy. they loosen up as the day goes on as well. super comfy and great for running errands and taking my little one to the park. i can look cute and feel comfy and i can give my yoga pants a break.
"These are super soft and relaxed. i have them in navy and lavender. i am 5'6"" and 130 lbs. and ordered them in a 28, which fits loosely, but comfortably."
"Was so thrilled to receive my dress in the mail. its just what i was looking for, for my staple summer dress. i love how i can wear it with or without the sweater top, and even can pair just the sweater top with my high-waisted shorts!"
"I really wanted to like his dress, but it was a big miss. big big miss. look at the way the skirt is attached to the dress in the photo. it goes up high on the sides leaving a short bodice. the sequined patterns hit right at my breasts, so it looked like glittery bra cups on the front. the back glittery pattern looked like bird wings on my back. it was far shorter than i expected. overall, it looked like i was desperately trying to be a sexy angel or fairy. bad bad bad."
"Great fabric but unfortunately it did not look good on me. maybe on a tall person, i'm only 5'4"". really wanted to like this..."
"The dress is cute, but i'm somewhat concerned that it will be sheer in the sunlight. i guess we'll have to wait and see!"
"I tried this on in the store in a regular medium and the size was fine, just the length. fortunately retailer will ship for free if you need a petite! i'm so excited to get this. i'm 5'1 and a bit busty, and the medium fit perfect. its very flattering and so comfortable! perfect for a hot summer day. or as the cute clerk in the store had it styled with a cropped jean jacket and a fun necklace. the styling idea's are endless. i'm waiting by the mailbox for it to arrive!"
This runs really large. i love it! sold out of xs p and xxs p... go figure :( size down if you are slim.
Bought this for my daughter. it's adorable on her. we're going to take it in at the waist so it doesn't look so sack-like; then it'll be perfect!
"I was disappointed with this jumpsuit. when i first saw it in the store, i thought i was going to love it. when i tried it on, the first issue is the fabric is too sheer. i could completely see the outline of my underwear and bra. it also runs way too big! i know the bottom is supposed to be loose and flowy, but the waist needs to be more tapered to off set that, and it's so baggy. the arm holes are also cut very low, so when you lift your arms you can see most of your bra on the sides 
i wante"
"Perfect for the summer weddings that i am attending. i am 5-1, 119#, 32dd and usually a sp. i tried on a regular s and xs in the store, and the s was huge. i ended up ordering the regular xs instead of the petite xs when the 20% off sale hit because i liked the extra length. great bra coverage...it is not too long at the armholes, or too low in the back. i will take it up a bit in the top seams just so it doesn't have quite so much decolletage, but it is wearable as is. this is much more of a ro"
"A sales associate found this for me at my local retailer. i probably would have never thought to try it on. i am 5'1'' and normally a size 8 or a medium. the size small was still too large, so i ordered a size small petite. it fits perfectly, looks adorable on, and is so comfortable. i can't wait for the warm weather to wear it!"
"This is a lovely piece, with great shape and details. i think it would really stand out at events. i ended up returning it. i don't have much occasion for cocktail dresses. i had trouble sending it back. it has a slip with the sheer overlay. the slip seemed a bit tight at the bottom hem for the shape of the dress."
"This was so unflattering. the bust was too high so it hit me weird on the boobs. the green was a beautiful, vibrant color but the fabric is so delicate that one wrong move would cause a snag."
"I opened the package and the dress is two pieces. it is the skirt part with an orange cami top that the sweater goes over. the sweater was too short for me, as i am busty and would not work. i ordered my normal size and the band around the rib cage did not go from side to side so i didn't try it on."
"Just purchased this- love how light and airy it is. perfect for throwing on on a warm summer day. it is soft and comfy, but it does run pretty large. i am normally a m, and in this the m was swimming on me. i purchased the s, and still loose and flowy. i wore a strapless bra with it, but will also try a bandeau or tank top."
"I'm very picky about jumpers, and this one is abolutely perfect! i love how it looks like a dress at first glance. it runs a little big because of the oversized fit it is supposed to have, i sized down because of the armpit area. nude garments and you'll be fine. this is going to sell out fast, don't wait for it to go on sale! (seriously my store is already out of xs's)"
Nice flowing summer sun dress. i was looking for something very simple and put a colorful kimono over. it. i put a bando under it. i think this dress can be for all ages as my friend in her 20s bought and loves this dress as well.
"I am 5'-7"" and 135 lbs, i bought a medium petite as i wanted the dress to hit at my knees, instead of midi. this dress is easily 2 sizes bigger than expected. the pattern was not flattering on my although i'm sure it would be for others. i was happy with the length..."
"This is one of those dresses that is just ""nice"" and can be one that you go to in a pinch.... it flows very nicely and you can dress it up and down. it's not the best quality in fabric...but if it was all silk you would have paid 3xs. i like it, it fits well...it's not outstanding or unusual. i think it is a bit pricey for what you get...but, it's a ""work horse"" dress...it will do you right whenever you need it to!"
This jumpsuit is the epitome of what i love about retailer! unique and absolutely beautiful. i love how it flows and on my petite frame when paired with heels makes me look taller. hopefully the designs for spring/summer are just as beautiful and comfortable as this piece. i plan to rock this with a cute belt and a bolo jacket.
"I loved this dress from the moment i saw it! i ordered it immediately, after reading the reviews, and felt confident in my dress size choice...but when it arrived it was big! i am 5'7"" 140lbs with an athletic build and i usually wear a 6 or 8 in dresses, so usually a small but sometimes a medium...because if this ""in between"" that i am, i ordered a small...and it was really too big. so sad...incalled a bunch of stores to try and find an xs but they are sold out everywhere.
style is fun and flir"
"This dress is great. it appears just as it does online. its soft, flowy and a thin chambray material. the straps are adjustable which makes it a good fit for all women. i am fuller in my hips and toosh and this dress fell beautifully over them. i tried a large (i normally do l or xl in retailer dresses) and there was plenty of room! i would have probably liked the xl more just because i prefer things oversized. the dress is a midi length, very breezy and airy. its extremely comfortable and very fl"

"I was worried at first that the metal leaves would come off easily. i was pleasantly surprised after a day at disneyland, i don't think i lost even one of them. this dress is super fancy but very comfy."
"These jeans have been the best pair of jeans i have ever worn. you could practically sleep in them, they are so comfortable, brushed softness, and stretch easily. they hug your body in a flattering way, that these jeans are worth the money spent, as you'll have them for a while."
"I'd been eyeing this for months, loving the look but afraid it'd be too young for me (i'm 58). i tried it on in the store and loved it, with one caveat: it hangs rather like a sack, so i think it needs a belt for waist definition. with a belt, it looks great. my measurements are 38-30-38 and i wear a medium. oh, and contrary to what other reviewers have said, i don't find that the fabric is too thin or transparent."
"I really wanted to love this dress. i bought it for a photoshoot that will be outdoors, and thought that the green color would be perfect. it is well made, but the fabric is lighter than expected. the biggest issues was the size. i am 5'7"" and typically a size ten. i ordered the ten and it fit like a 14-16. it was huge. if you order this, i would say size down two sizes."
"Great fit. smooth, comfortable material. wrinkles, but nothing an iron can't fix. beautiful colors, i got both the teal and the black."
"This dress is beautiful and would make an excellent party dress for winter. it is well made and the details are pretty. however the waist is cut in sort of a scallop shape, so it is higher on the sizes and dips down in the middle over the stomach. i wear a size l or 10 in dresses at retailer, and it just did not flatter my body type at all. for a thinner, narrow silhouette, i suppose it would look better, like it does on the model. i had to return it."
"I tried this on in the store last night and decided to order it today. it is a really beautifully made and flattering dress, with very interestingly cut seams. the fabric is a distinctive flower pattern that has been overlaid to appear almost abstract. gorgeous and high quality!

fit: i am 5'6"" and curvy, usually a size 14/16, and the xl fits quite roomy on me (that's the size i ordered because i like flowy things). so it definitely runs large. usually i have better luck with a-line dress shap"
"I bought this dress for its green color and flowy design to wear at an irish fest held in the hot summer. it's perfect! being of irish descent with red hair and fair skin, i love all shades of green, and this green dress is no exception. the color is lovely and eye-catching and cool. as to the sizing, i usually wear a size 8, but to make sure due to the design, i ordered an 8 and a 6. there wasn't a great difference between the two dresses, but the size 6 top was a bit more fitted and looked bet"
"I just bought this at the store. i simply couldn't resist! it is very light and comfortable and could easily be dressed up or dressed down, sandals and a crossbody bag for exploring the city, strappy healed sandals and some flashy jewelry for a garden party or day event, slip on booties and a cardigan for the evening. can't wait to rock it. in terms of sizing, i am 5'5 150 with 36dd bust and some hips and booty. usually i am a size 6-8/m in dresses and pants but in true retailer style, i ended up"
"Great jumpsuit ! even better ""in person""; elegant and stylish. i'am 5'7 and 165lb , m fits perfectly! material is not see- throug ( that was my biggest concern). sooo happy that i got it."
"I purchased this in the mauve color. beautiful color with tan skin for the summer, but also perfect for fall. the material is very thin but not sheer at all. has quite a bit of drape/swing to it so i sized up to make sure it was long enough. it fits me like it fits the model shown here. i am about 5'4"" 115lbs and 32b and am keeping the small."
"I originally ordered this in green, and unlike another reviewer, i thought the color was perfect for spring. it is trendy, flattering and fun in green, but perhaps not a color i would wear long-term, so i decided to return it and order it in red and black. i also noted the boxy cut, and if that is what you want, it runs true to size. however, if, like me, you want something a little more form fitting, consider ordering down a size or two (depending on your chest size,) and just carefully shimmy"
"Beautiful dress. good quality. tts. i'm 5 feet 120 lbs. ordered my small petite. no issues. however, the green is very bright. the deal killer for me was when my hub said it looked like a starbucks barista's apron! it's going back. i marked yes if you plan on purchasing a black dress it's a yes."
"I tried this on in the store - i tried regular medium which was way too big except in the chest where it was really tight. the material was a little itchy on me (but maybe its because the chest was tight). the color is lovely (pink). im sure someone will love it but if you are petite, i would order the petite and maybe size up if you are busty."
"I tried these on at my local retailer, and was like, no way am i spending almost $300 on a pair of jeans. alas, i could not stop thinking about them. the pictures really don't do them justice. they are a more substantial jean, have a distressed look, without being fragile. and yet they are so soft, so comfortable, you really just don't want to take them off. they do have a bit of stretch, but hold their shape all day long. the length and taper are perfect, in that you can wear them with boots, san"
"I love this dress, i disagree with the review saying it was too sheer. this is a thicker material and doesnt need a slip, it is beautiful and is so comfy. it looks good with heels or sandals. i definately recommend this dress, it would look good on any body type."
"This top is cute and could be worn to work or casually. being tall, i love how long this shirt is! definitely recommend!"
I purchased the gorgeous green color. i love that i can wear this with leggings and sandals in warm weather or boots and scarves when it's cooler outside. the best thing is that it has pockets to slip my phone in! the color is very flattering and i get lots of compliments when i wear it!
I bought the blue pattern and really have found this print to be very fun and flattering and the tunic style great for work and play. highly recommend!!!
"Like a baby doll top, with almost an empire waist going on.  feels comfortable and super flowy. i got a size m and i swing between m and l in most brands. the button stitching are a bit loose and will fray after some wears, i can tell. but i'm borderline on taking it back still because there are hidden side pockets! crazy--like it was a fluke or something. would fit a piece of paper or tissues. not keys or phones though."
"This is a beautiful sweater -- soft, lovely color and easy to wear. the current photo is more true to the length. i am 5'2"" and 128 pounds and ordered the regular sm and it fits just below my hips."
"I'm 5""0"" and weigh 105 lbs. i purchased the xxs and it was super-wide, and big all over. it looked like a pregnancy top and did not lay as nicely as shown on the model. also, not shown on the model is the front is short and the back is very long. this would work better on a taller person. i just find it odd that a xxs is still too big. the quality of the fabric and the print is good and the lace-up in the back is cute."
"Like other reviewers i was hesitant to spend this much on a pair of jeans. however, i purchased them at  20% off on retailer day and...honestly...they look so good i probably would have paid full price. these jeans are fresh!"
"After reading the reviews, i ordered this dress in an xs and sp. i'm 5' 3"" and 120 lbs. the xs was too long and too big on the bottom while being too tight in the chest. the sp fits perfectly. i'm wearing this to a wedding and know that i will get lots of use out of it for many different occasions."
"I always look for things to hide ""parts"" without making my ""parts"" look even more pronounced. this top is much cuter in person than online. it has floral edging around the neck and lace up area i didn't notice. the length is perfect, the sleeve length is perfect and it makes me feel thin (even though it has stripes!). perfect spring summer top."
"Fit is true to size but keep in mind this dress has a ""box-like"" fit. i am debating whether to have mine taken in a little under the arms.
the material isn't what i expected but i still love it. the dress has a more textured/thick fabric instead of the light, somewhat silky fabric that the photo portrays.
i am very happy with the color!"
"This shirt is easy, breezy, comfy, and stylish - everything i want as a busy mom. all the patterns are beautiful it i went with the blue motif as well as the floral print because they felt fun and easy to wear with jeans or white pants. this definitely fit a full size large for me. i tried my usual s plus xs thinking the shoulders might be too tight, but the xs was perfect. happy to have this beauty in the rotation!"
I've been eyeing this top up in the floral pattern for a while and finally ordered it when i had 15% off. i really don't think it's worth the price and it's not very flattering. i think it would look better on someone less busty - it seemed to accent my bust. it's definitely not my favorite piece and unfortunately i will be returning.
"This is my first pair of realllly expensive jeans, and they were worth every penny. i love the fit, the distressing, everything about them. they make me feel like i look amazing, which is what good jeans should do! i wear a 31 in pilcro jeans, but based on some reviews went up to a 32 in these and they are perfect. also, i'm 5'6 but the crop length hits at my ankle, which is perfect."
Shortened it to knee length and it was perfect. material is soft. comfortable to wear. can be paired with wedges or pumps or flats. fits true to size.
"Super cute and flattering shirt, the long tunic-style makes it so you can dress it up or down, so cute and comfy!"
"It looks great on the model but not on me. on me, it looked more like a sack of potatoes. the fabric is unexpected for the style in my opinion. it is very thick. i'll be returning it because it is not flattering on me."
This shirt is just so easy breezy! i got the blue motif and love the pattern. the top is loose but it's supposed to fit that way. i have a feeling this will be my go to for the spring summer! i'm about 136lbs and ordered a small.
This dress looked gorgeous in the monthly catalog. ordered in hopes to wear in easter. i felt it was frumpy and just ok. color was pretty but overall; i didn't love it like i hoped to.
"If there ever was the perfect feminine dress, this would be it ."
"I'm small (4'11, 98 pounds and 34a) so the regular xs looks like a baby doll dress on me.  i just wear the tunic with a tank top underneath (or i can wear the tunic by itself) and leggings plus a pair of boots.  the top part is slightly baggy so if you want tight fitting, is size down to xxs.  i got the yellow flower and white + grey one and plan to get the navy one soon.  the quality is good and you can machine wash it with cold water.  i plan to use a tide sweater garment bag to wash it (i put"
"I had reservations about this top based on other reviews, but it looked cute on the model so i took my chances. i have an athletic build--not model-thin, but not dumpy either--and this top made me look very frumpy and matronly. the sleeves were especially unflattering. i purchased it in an ps and might have done better with a pxs."
"I ordered the black and it was a soft black, which i loved. i felt like the shirt was a little boxy (i was hoping the top would have been a bit more fitted (the arm holes are loose) and the bottom a little longer, but i like it enough that i am keeping it. works well to wear to work."
"I usually wear a size xs or s in retailer tops, ordered this top in an s and it was so wide on the sides and huge it fit like a tent.  not even remotely flattering.  i thought about ordering it in an xs, however, i could tell the xs was still going to have way too much fabric.  back it goes."
"I initially purchased this shirt in the grey motif color, size l (my usual size, i'm 5'8"" size 14). unfortunately i found the shirt very roomy, but loved the pattern and style. so i ordered a medium and much to my surprise it fit much better. i'm very happy with my purchase."
"I bought the dress in black. it is very elegant with a fun flare, suits my taste. it does run a size too small like other reviewer mentioned. the material has no give at all. i couldn't breathe in my regular size. one size up fits like a glove. it is a perfect party dress to show your free and fun spirit!"
"I agree with the previous comments. the vest runs a little large, so you can easily size down for a more form-fitting fit. it is so soft and the colors are lovely ... will be a welcome addition when the weather turns a little cooler. i am so glad i purchased this vest!"
Fit great - maybe a bit large....i bought a l (typically i go between a large and extra large) and there is room to put a thick sweater on underneath it.  this goes with just about everything!
"I am a solid size 6 in most brands, top and bottom, 5'3"" tall, 125#. i have long legs, short torso, and fairly broad shoulders - i almost never wear petite sizes.however, this top in the regular small size could be a maternity dress on me! i am literally swimming in it, and it is quite long. however, i can still make it work, with a cami underneath and leggings or skinny jeans... i like it, did not return, and will buy another color, but will go with petite x-small in the future."
"This top is such a great color and style. i did have to go a size down, as i typically wear a medium. the style is very forgiving. it looks great with shorts and jeans! it's staple!"
I just bought this top yesterday in the yellow. i can't wait until it warms up a little more to wear it. it's very comfortable and very cute. i did have to size down. i may get one of the other prints as well.
I ordered the yellow/floral version in size xl. it fits me just as shown with the model so it's true to size. it's very comfortable and made well. the floral looks the same in person as in the photos too.
"I love this dress!! it has a beautiful european flair, and more beautiful in person. i don't agree with the other reviewers that its see through-the fabric is a good quality, and thicker than you would think. the variable length is the best part of the dress. the color looks beautiful with a tan summer glow!"
"Got the flower print and it is really a nice top. covers the butt!. i normally need a xl, but in this top i got a large."
"I love the idea, and color, very flattrering and easy to trhrow on, however, i need the petite in this one, and they sold out in the neutral color. it looks too big in eregular sizing, and since it combines xs/s, it is made slightly bigger. material is soft enough."
"I received this in the mail a few days ago, and was so pleased with it except that it was huge! i am normally a 10/12 in most things so i ordered a large. i was swimming in it in all areas - shoulders and bust bothered me most because i need a waist on shirts so i don't look larger than i am. i liked it enough to o ahead and order a size down. i ordered a medium and medium petite because the top is quite long and i think i could get away with wearing it with leggings or tights if i were looking"
"I have received so many compliments on this top. it really looks exactly like it does on the model, and i'm not as thin as she is. i am 5'5"" and 134 lbs,, small on top, and bought the small in this top. the v-neck is very flattering and is hangs so nicely that it does not make me look hippy. looks great from all views. i paired it with white pencil pants and wedge heels. also, the black lace detail down the sides looked great when i paired it with black yoga pants and flip flops. the colors are"
"Everyone has said it, so i'll just add my two cents - this is a great, soft, flattering top. i bought two, one in white and one in black, and i have never worn them without getting compliments. i sometimes wear them buttoned up, and sometimes completely unbuttoned to expose tanks or bathing suits. (i live in florida, and these tops make great beach cover ups). i am 5'7"" and over 160 but not busty, and the medium was swimming on me, but i think this particular shirt is supposed to be that way. su"
"Perfect party dress - well constructed, bra hidden at arms and on top, what more can you ask for? i felt like betty draper the moment i put it on. i'm normally a 6, but the 4 (while fitted) looked amazing and didn't pull."
I love this shirt! it hides my tummy perfectly without being too baggy! super cute!!
"I wanted to love this top, but it unfortunately did not work for me. the material has a nice weight and feel to it, and while i love the pattern, the shape leaves something to be desired. the cap sleeves were a little tight on my arms, and the cut of the sleeves made my arms look big. the body of this shirt reminded me of a loose maternity top. for reference, i am 5'10"" 140 lbs and typically a size 6. i wear a small in retailer clothes, and got a small in this top. i think an xs would have been to"
"The fabric is wonderful, flows nicely and soft. i am 5'7"", 145lbs and usually wear between a s and m. i ordered a s in this due to the majority of reviews and found it to fit my shoulders well and length was fine. after reading the reviews i was so excited to get it but for me it actually made me look larger. there was too much material for me on the bottom and it actually made me look like i had a ""pooch"", never a good thing. i thought of returning for a m as i thought maybe it would have hung"
"I bought the tangerine version of this dress for my brother's summer wedding in the south, and i can't wait to wear it. cotton material has a touch almost like linen, but not rough. nice and hearty fabric. tangerine color is beautiful, more salmon than coral. wearing it with a little shoulder shrug and the laika inca shoes?the shoes aren't on the retailer site anymore, but i found them at my local store. just perfect."
"I purchased this top in white. it is see through so i wear a tank or cami underneath. i usually wear xs or s in retailer tops and in this one, i purchased the xs, but wish i had bought a s. the problem is the top is just small enough to pull slightly between the top two buttons. for reference, i am 5'6, weigh 128 lbs, 34b bra size, 28 jean size, and small boned. i currently carry most of my weight in my hips and waist. my normal weight is 110-112 lbs and i add this to point out that i am out of sh"
"Picture definitely does not do this vest justice.  i saw it on a rack and had to try on and instantly loved the look and feel.  i am 5'9"" - 135 lbs - size 6 and the small works for me.  the vest will work with ivory, black, grey, and red underneath.  i love the little bits of fur sticking out of the seams.  the back has fitted seams to give it a trim look.  there are small pockets in the front as well.  definitely worth the 108$ asking price."
"This dress is great! it fits true to size and the pockets are very unnoticable!
my only note is that the first picture of the dress show the dress to be a bit darker than the actual dress. the dress colour more closely resembles that of the other two photos."
"I'm very pale, and on me the rose color looked really washed out. the catalog photo is not an accurate representation. look at the product shot for a truer representation. it's slightly see-through and was too close to the color of my skin. i think it would look delicious on someone who has darker skin, though."
I purchased this in 2 colors. the black which is really actually a dark grey( no complaints) and the cream with black print version. i have worn both at least once a week and receive compliments everytime! looks great with skinny pants or jeans. great alone or layered with a jacket or cardigan. does run on the looser side fyi
"I ordered this dress in the blood orange and have a few complaints. while it appears to be made with quality, it runs really large. also, in the picture the fabric appears to have a sheen and be somewhat dressy. the actual fabric is just flat cotton. it's a very casual dress, not as dressy as pictured. it's also quite shapeless on. i'm returning it."
"This is my favorite dress i have ever purchased. as a 6' tall woman, it's hard to find flattering dresses that are long enough for my legs. this dress is classic, comfortable, and truly flattering. i love the blush color and did not have the issues that other people listed for the color being see-through. i can't get enough of this style...i'll be buying it in black too...ooopss :)"
"This dress was not what i had hoped! from the online pictures, i had high hopes, but the fit was really wonky and the material seemed cheap. the arm holes were too big and made the dress seem more like a bathing suit cover up than a classy summer dress. needless to say, it's going back!"
"Bought this top in white and blue motif. it fits me great and looks adorable. the only comment is that the holes for the buttons are a little too big but it's an easy fix.
this top looks great dressed up or down. would definitely recommend!"
"Just purchased this yesterday in the store and i can't wait to wear it! it is a perfect spring/summer top when you just want to wear something pretty and comfortable! i agree that it is big but that is the style of this shirt. so if you're ok with this look, you will love this shirt! i took my usual medium and the prints are adorable! a great addition to my wardrobe!"
Love this shirt. tried it on in 2 of the colors and both were very flattering. the quality of the shirt is great. worth the price for sure!
"Love this top! i receive so many compliments wearing it, even from my teenage boys! runs large, but that's the style of it, very flowy. very flattering."
"I loved this top in the blue and wanted so badly for it to fit however it was very unflattering on my 5'7"" frame. the bottom hemline is straight across all around whereas i thought it was longer in the back. i could see this looking great on a really petite frame. runs large, xs fit however wasn't flattering"
"Didn't work on this curvy gal.
sizing up would have helped with the button gaps, but the flowy shape of the blouse would have looked too maternity on a larger size.
major pass."
"The rose color is lighter than the photo of the model in front of the pink building, but on the other photos it does look lighter so i wasn't surprised.  my dress fits very nicely. i love the drop waist, the loose fit at the hips, and the flare of the ruffles.  the back is just like the model too. i thought it may be boxy but it comes in at the waist and goes a-line. perfect. i ordered the xl because it wanted it to be loose like on the model.  i was afraid because of my large dd chest it would"
"I am so happy i purchased this top in 2 colors while it was on sale. i have the navy/white pattern and the green. both are vibrant and fun. i'm 8 months pregnant and these fit me currently. i can see them being a great top for post baby and on as well. i'll probably layer this in the fall and winter with a chambray jacket or a loose knit sweater. my only complaint (which is why i gave 4 stars) the top button comes undone very easily. it also pulls a bit at the top 2 buttons, but i may be able to"
"I'm so short that this could be a dress! runs a little big, but very forgiving. the green color is so vibrant! love love love!"
"This light blouse is beautiful and true to size. i ordered the black one and love it!
i would recommend this product"
"Stopped in to my local retailer today specifically for this top. i was pleasantly surprised - the green is even more vibrant in person! just gorgeous. typically a size small but based on reviews tried on the extra small. still a tad roomy but portland doesn't carry petite sizing aaaaandidon'twanttopayforshipping... remedy that, retailer portland!"
Wanted to like this top but it looks terrible and does not lay right. the bust line is not tight enough to contrast the rest of the top being flowy. does not give any shape to the body. do not recommend for anyone with a medium to large chest.
"This sweater poncho is a nice versatile piece to wear in the fall. wear a blouse or tee under for extra warmth for the maine winters. love the side buttons and the uniqueness of this poncho. true to size, great color. lot's of compliments."
"Love this top. bought it in both color ways. just adorable and washes well. great option for larger ladies. 
retailer needs to provide more xls to be available in the stores. i shop at the pasadena store and see so many women my size shopping right next to me, and there is nothing for us. it is so sad that we want to spend our money with you, but you don't want it."
Like the extra details on the neck and back - and it's versatile to wear everywhere
"Agree with other contributer - this is a great piece to snag on sale. i bought this 2 months post partum with the intention of hiding the post baby belly - which is does well! i think it fits true to size (i'm typically l and this l fit well). i can see how certain body types it would look maternity, but i'm short and curvy and the blouse is flattering. it's lightweight, so i plan to add a cardigan in the fall/winter."
"This dress is a bit scratchy, but overall i liked the fabric well enough. on someone blond and fair, the peach color washes out a bit. the issue for me with the dress is that front is just too short for my height (i'm 5 9 1/2). it looked a bit obscene. 

the small otherwise fit me great. i have broad shoulders, small chest and and slim."
"This beauty arrived in my store today...and despite all my gals telling me that i own too many vests, i just had to have this one. i've always wanted a cozy fur or sherpa vest...but i'm curvy and always feel like those add bulk. this one only has sherpa on one side (the softest most cozy sherpa ever) and its not too bulky! the print is even better than it appears online...in fact, the vest almost appears pink online, and its not in person. there is much more variation in color in person! i adore"
"I love swing tops. the more swingy, the better! this top is so fun. its a little hard to tell online, but its made of two fabrics. most of the fabric is a thin t-shirt material, and then theres a panel on one side thats more of a silky fabric. its so so cool! the colors are just as they appear online, and the print is fun and edgy. i have larger arms, so i love the length of the sleeves. the other reviewer said it was cropped, but i did not have that experience. in fact i was able to wear mine w"
"I really wanted to love this dress. two lovely associates paired it with the desideria bib necklace and the black dakota cardigan, which gives the outfit definition and elegance. but the dress by itself would have needed altering to fit my 34-b top. i chose size m because of the length-- the small was 1 1/2 "" shorter in front (i am 5'8"") in the end, i realized i would probably choose my other favorites from my closet. but it will be stunning on the right person."
"I read all the reviews and was hoping that this top would work for me, but it did not. i ordered a size smaller than usual and it was still way too big. it was not flattering at all on my curvy frame. overall, it looked more like a maternity top on me then anything else! if you're tall and slender, i think this top would work!"
"I'm still on the fence with this shirt. i have the grey - it almost looks like a cheetah design up close. i'm 5'3"""
"I love this dress - originally ordered the medium, which is my normal size, especially because i am tall. the arm holes were gaping, and so i returned for the small. the small is perfect. it fits exactly as on the model, and i didn't have a problem with the color being see-through. it really is so unique but so simple. the color is perfect. 

i took a single star off because it is not lined - for the price, this would have been nice."
"This is a cute top, especially the material design. i like tops that go over my bottom and this does. if i had a problem it is with the sizing. the fact that it was only online so i could not try it on made it difficult to know really what size to get. some reviews said it was true to size and others said go down a size. i did go down a size but it still hangs a little big. but i still love the overall look. i am also petite which is what i ordered."
"Cute white t-shirt different style but didn't work on my body type so i returned it 
 good price point 
 basic fabric"
"Nice, flowy, comfy top with soft fabric. there's a lot of fabric below the waist - it could probably work as a maternity top - but it drapes nicely rather than looking overwhelming. i do find that the buttons gap a little at the chest, despite the top fitting loosely on me, so i have to wear a layer under it."
"I've been on the hunt for the perfect dress to wear for my daughter's first birthday party. since we are throwing a traditional korean first birthday, i was looking for a dress you might wear to a daytime wedding or a fancy brunch. i just purchased this dress today in the store and it fits my needs perfectly. 

i disagree with the first reviewer who mentioned that this dress was too sheer. this dress is a thicker fabric so i do not think i will need a slip when wearing it. it does drape nicely"
I absolutely love this shirt! even though it has a large flowy design it looks wonderful. the print is so unique and will transition to autumn beautifully! i loved it so much i got both colors.
"I would describe the color as more blush. the fabric does not have a sheen as in the model picture. the fit is much cuter on than hanging. i'm a 36c and the extra small is just a bit tight in the bust, otherwise i like the fit everywhere else. i'm going to order a small and see how it fits. at 5' 3"" it's also longer on me than on the model but not a deal breaker. looks kind of 1920's vintage on. my fabric is not see through it's more of a twill fabric but not quite as heavy as that."
"I agree with the other reviewer that the color isn't as pink in person and more subtle. my thoughts below on some other things:
__________
pros:
- pockets! makes it so fun and chic with the overall style.
- the material is lovely and breathable. i didn't find it sheer at all! of course, i didn't wear it outside the dressing room. the material is thicker but it hangs on the body well.
- runs ""mostly"" tts. i only tried on the medium and it fit everywhere being slightly tighter in the chest. i"

"This shirt is so very pretty in person. the detail on the neckline and the lace up on the back are so cute and give the shirt just a bit of whimsy, making it more unique than your usual flowy t-shirt. it lays perfectly and the material is very soft and comfy. you can wear it casual or dress it up. i may get another one because this is the kind of shirt i will wear constantly!"
"I bought two, one in white and one in blue print and wore the blue print top once and loved it. then i washed it according to the instructions on the tag (in cold gentle cycle and hung to dry). it shrunk up 4"" in the length and 2"" in the width and now it doesn't fit at all. also, after one wear, the buttons are coming off (before i even put it in the wash) and it's covered in loose threads. the quality is just not there. i'm going to return both and show the sales lady the difference in size on"
"I usually wear a size 28 & the fit was perfect. highly recommend, many compliments."
"I fell in love with this dress from the moment i saw it in store. i tried it on immediately and knew i had to have it. it fits a little big -- definitely size down. but other than that, i have never felt more beautiful than when i wear this. the color is a perfect blush pink and the drop waist/tiered skirt make you feel downright bridal when wearing it, despite it being the perfect fabric for day. i find that this dress is perfect for those days at work when i have an event later.. it can be dre"
"....that's what i look like wearing this dress. a sad, sad, sack. the fabric is less than ideal, and there is no shape to speak of. i love that it has pockets but that's about it. there was just way too much fabric for a petite person. this dress has got to be good on someone, sadly that person was not me."
"This is a such a cute top. can be dressed up for work or worn more casually. very flattering. i'm 5'6"" and 125lb. i was borderline between the xs and s but ended up with the s because it was a tad longer and more 'tunic-y.' bought two colors!"
"I loved this top so much i bought it in both colors. size down because it run very large, but it is nice and flowy. i'm 5'11"" and slim and the top hung nicely on me."
"I wanted to love this, was so excited when i ordered it online. the fabric (blue and white) was beautiful, but the cut was bad. it fit me like a maternity top, and made me look like i was 6 months along. i have a feeling that the models had theirs pinned back, in the back, because it does not lay flat like that in front, it has a lot of fabric with no place to go but up and out. returning."
"This is a very flattering / soft sweater. the pockets make it so much cuter & do not make me look ""thick"". highly recommend!"
"I fell in love with this dress when i saw it in the catalog and ordered it immediately. i was a bit disappointed that the dress is a little lighter than the pink showed in the catalog but it didn't deter my liking it because it's still a lovely shade of pink. the fabric takes a bit getting used to though - i thought it would be silkier but it's really a thicker fabric. i ordered a size small and i usually wear size 4. the dress drowned me. so i returned it for an xs, which fit me beautifully. so"
"This is such an adorable tee. the stripes and lace up details are super cute and on trend. i usually take a xxs and that is what i took in this tee. i tried the xs and at 5""1 and 104 pounds it looked a bit loose and long on me. love this tee and highly recommend this one!"
"This shirt runs large, so order down a size. it is comfortable, cute and great for transitioning from summer into fall. adding jewelry really dresses this top up. can't wait to layer it with kimono, vest, pashminas or wraps. great with sandals or boots. glad i bought both colors. it looks much better on, than in the photo/on hanger. great purchase and can't wait to wear!"
"I purchased this poncho online in the cream color. when it arrived i tried it on to decide whether or not to keep it. i immediately went on line and purchased the taupe color , as well. thank goodness it didn't come in 5 more colors! this sweater is so versatile and beautifully detailed, plus it is very soft. you take one look at it and you know the quality! i think you could wear this dressed up or down and it would be perfect either way. i do agree, it is not quite as long as pictured , but pe"
"The green is a deep, beautiful shade. the fabric and fir is very flattering!"
"Love this white shirt! it fits great and gives you a little breathing room around the waist. this goes with shorts, skirts, and jeans. i will be wearing it all summer"
"I loved this dress on. the material was quite different than expected, almost a canvas-y feel to it. ran a little large, but so cute."

"I really like the look of the top when it is photographed on other people but it just isn't for me. the fabric is stiffer than i would have expected and not very moveable. the fit is not quite right on me. the longer sleeves detract from the look of the shirt. i also generally prefer things a little more form fitting of which this is not. it was not very comfortable for me either, so this was clearly not a win for me."
"This top is absolutely adorable, fits small on top and then flares out a bit as shown. i bought it months ago and haven't worn it yet though. might try it with white jeans as shown."
"Bought this top at my local store and tried it on as soon as i got home. yikes! it was way too billowy, i looked like i was pregnant. will be trying the next size down on in the store to see if it is billowy."
"Gorgeous baby blue lace is a must see. i received many compliments. my only gripe is that i don't love when shirts have those connecting camisoles (which make it harder to put on) as i would much rather just have a sewn in lining, but it didn't deter me. i am 5'5"", 135lbs, 34c, muscular/curvy frame and a size 4 fit perfectly."
Super cute poncho to add to my wardrobe.  love the grey color and the material is super soft.  glad i snagged this up for less than $30!
"Great top!! love the fit, it pairs great with dark denim and pearls!! i ordered a 00 and am a 32c cup and 24-25 waist"
This top/jacket is less red than it appears in the pictures - more of a wine color (as it is labeled) but it is pretty and the gold details are nice.
This sweater is a perfect transition piece!  the material is really soft. while it has the shape of a poncho it is cut nicely and doesn't make you look like a big blob.
I am obsessed with this top. it is even more gorgeous in person.... a real showstopper!
Beautiful color and a great lightweight piece for fall layering. the petite sizing was perfect for me. more like a belted kimono. very happy with this purchase
It's really cute but seems expensive for the type of fabric. i thought it would be more substantial. got lots of compliments .
Really wanted to love dress but something was off with fit. fabric is lovely and zipper detail nice unfortunately style was not for me.
"This a lovely piece. you have to see it close up to appreciate the subtle details. i typically wear xxsp or xsp, so i did not expect this to fit, but decided to try it because i liked the style. as a petite, many poncho styles overwhelm me and look like tents. not this one. the xxs fit nicely - just the right length and width. i am 5'1"" and 108 lbs. i think one of the reasons this has not been popular is because it only shows up when searching on ponchos, and not when you search for sweaters. it"
"In the midst of the end-of-winter doldrums, i tried this cute top on. springy. powdery. happy. the lace is soft, not too stiff or scratchy, and lightweight enough to transition nicely into summer. because the cami is a separate piece, i also envision wearing this as a top over a slip-dress with some retro mary janes. the sleeve length makes it fair game for late winter, too. yay!"
"Absolutely love this top. it is beautiful, well made and so unique."
"An absolutely gorgeous, but poorly fitting blouse. the bottom part is way too billowy and inconsistent with the fitted top half. got it on sale and still returned it."
"This top is really pretty and i received a lot of compliments on it. i said it ran true to size, but really the torso part runs a little big. if i had sized down, i think it would have been too tight in the arms. the cami that came with it kept falling out, which is no big deal, but be aware that the strings might not hold the cami with the shirt. overall, it's a really pretty blue and the details make it worth it."
The blue lace with the white top underneath is very pretty. unfortunately i did not like how billowy it was below the bra line.
It is definitely pinned back on the model in the photograph. it made my 5 foot frame look short and wide.
"For reference i am 5'5' 138 lbs with an hourglass figure and my usual small fit perfectly. the problems: 1. this skirt is not black but a charcoal gray/purple. 2. the sipper is reinforces with a stiff boarder on the inside so no matter where i put the waist it sticks straight out making me look like i have a tail under my skirt. in other words, i had a very pointy butt. also the slit or tulip part of the skirt goes all the way up to the waist, it needed to be tacked to the other part of the skir"
"I knew i wanted this top the moment i saw it, so onto my wishlist it went until it went on sale! it fits beautifully in my normal size and i love that it already has a coordinating tank top. i get compliments whenever i wear it- think hd in paris might be my new go-to!"
"This is probably a blouse for curvy women. with that i mean large breasted. i am a 40d and the xl fits well and the cleavage is in the limit of ok for the office. the bottom is a little too large but not too long. however, the fabric feels extremely comfortable and it stretches but it doesn't lose the shape. i am tempted to buy 2 more. if you are thin, you probably need to size down."
This tee is super soft and thin. perfect for hot humid days. i went with the neutral version and it is adorable with chino shorts or jean shorts. i found it ran big.. i purchased in xs and still pretty baggy.
"I've been buying stevie ankles for years from retailer and been very happy. the past two pairs i bought had a heavy chemical smell, which i imagine is some kind of starch/chemical to keep the denim stiff. with the first pair, after enough washes to get rid of the bad smell (4), they lost all form and looked terrible since they were washed i couldn't return them. the 2nd pair arrived with the same heavy smell and i returned them. it may be they are made elsewhere now, but it's disappointing."
"Beautiful dress! excellent detail! loved everything about this dress except for the weight. this dress is very heavy which limits my wearing options in fl. given the fabric, this is a great special occasion dress."
I'm so incredibly disappointed. the dress is beautiful but the one i received is torn and has multiple strands of beads missing. poor quality control.
"Yep. this is snug, so maybe you might consider upping your normal size. but here's the annoying thing for me...the buttons fell off. not kidding. the first i wore this blouse and two buttons came off. when i looked at the other ones i saw that they all needed to be resewn to keep them attached. what a bother. but i'm doing it because the cotton poplin is nice and the little ruffle is a nice touch that i really like . where am i going to find another? so i'll fix it up the way it should have been"
"These leggings are wonderful. they are incredibly soft, and stay in place when working out."

I initially tried this on in store and fell in love with the beautiful cut out details and fit. the star design is really cute and unique and the blue color is not see-through at all. i eventually had to buy the blouse online because i could not stop thinking about it. also machine washable is a major plus.
"Another shirt i really wanted to love. i adore green but so few tops are made in this color. (please make more!!) however, this shirt didn't work for me. i think it's a matter of where your curves live. the shirt was true to size, but my boobs meant i was showing more cleavage than the model, and the top part felt more like a bib than embroidery. sad coz it is lovely and feels lovely on. probably a great shirt for different body types. would love to see more green clothing...."
"I am reasonably petite, but i like sweaters very oversized and large, so i ordered this sweater in a large. i was very disappointed when the sweater came because while the sleeves and upper chest area were in large, the length of the sweater did not at all increase when the size did. because the lower part of the sweater did not increase in size, the sweater ended up looking very awkward, with the chest and sleeves very large and long but then a very tight and short (waist-length) stomach. i do"
"I wanted to love this dress, and thought it would be perfect for a barn wedding i have coming up. it was allllllmost right but sadly fell short. the bib that hangs over the bust hits in a really unflattering mid point that makes you look wide. nipple tassels effect. plus i would feel the urge to keep pulling it down. did notice some of the puckering others mentioned but didn't bother me, however, the way the lining and the dress line up at the bottom did. so close, so sad"
"I ordered the grey/yellow ""here comes the sun"" shirt. it's cute, but it runs quite large and isn't special enough for the price. meh."
"This dress has special written all over it. the poms at the hem and bodice, as well as the rows of black seed beads push are the kind of details that stand out. i like all the varying textures. it looks great with sandals or short boots. fits true to size. a nice sassy length."
"I ordered the light pink version in size xl. the details of the top and the shade of pink are pretty. but, the shirt fits me much shorter than on the model. i'm not quite 5 ft. 6 inches so it should have worked. the material is thin so i was able to stretch it out to give more length. it does look stretched-out now though. i washed it and it shrank a bit so i stretched it again. this is a top that i kept to wear under vests. the pretty colors and the softness of the material make it worth keepin"
I found this dress at my local retailer must be a web order return i feel in love with it once i put it on its better in person that online but it does run a little tight in the chest area  it was fine for me as i'm not big busted
"I wanted to love this dress as it would have been perfect for a wedding i have in october however, the fit was awful;. the dress was heavy with a funky liner. it also had these little black straps around the top of the arm/neck that looked out of place. it ran true to size but i have a large chest (32dd) and it was pretty fitted around the area but loose everywhere else. 

sadly, dress had to be returned."
"I tried these on in-store not intending to buy them (was trying on shirts and needed to see how they would look with jeans!) and loved them! great ""medium blue"" color and they fit me so nicely (i am 5'2"" with actual hips and thighs :) ...the price is a bit high for me though. hoping to find a pair at some point when they are on sale!"
"It is such a cute design and very soft and comfortable, but the picture for this product is very deceiving! it looks like the sweater is fairly long in the pictured product page, but it is considerably short. i am nearly six foot tall, but thought by this picture it would be lengthy, not at all!
it is a beautiful sweater, might work better for a shorter stature."
I ordered this blouse online bc i couldn't find it in my local stores once it was on sale. the fabric is so delicate. the cutouts had already frayed and in some places torn. had to return it.
"I like this top. yes it is very cropped and fitted but that's the style as shown on the model in the picture. but its true this style may not fits everyone. it probably flatters those of athletic or petite figure more than a full figure. i am 5' 6"" 110#. my usual size is xs. the top looks small to me at first so i tried both size xs and s. i took the xs cause i like it look fitted than loose. i wear this top with high waist fitted skirts or pants and it looks great. if this top can be an inch lo"
Very disappointed. the cutouts started to rip the first time i wore it. i've only worn it twice and i love it but the cut outs are embarrassing.
"Huge bummer. this top is definitely a crop/midi-top. plus, it's cream, not white like shown in the photos. i'm returning it today."
Love this soft sweatshirt. the peplum makes it a little different and the quality is great. go to piece for spring. loose fitting but true to size in shoulders.
"I was so excited to get this dress. i need it for a wedding, and i thought i had hit the jackpot. the dress arrived with a small tear. the seams are puckered and badly seen.  for an almost $300.00 dress, the quality is terrible. i expect better from retailer. i'm so disappointed."
"This is a very pretty shirt which is too narrow across the back. i need to be able to move my arms freely at work, so this did not work for me. you may be able to size up for a better fit if moving your arms is important to you."
"Beautiful and very feminine look but run big. i m 5ft 105 lbs curvy , size 00 fit me well"
"I really like this jacket. very comfortable, nice material. i like the weight of this jacket, i wore it alone but it will be cute with a t-shirt under it too."
"Ordered this dress for a summer wedding. it is so cute! true to size, well made with a hint of tulle. super comfortable for moving and dancing. winner!"

"I purchased this shirt in grey. i loved the color and the details, especially the lace on the shoulders. i just found the fit to be off for me. the style certainly calls for a relaxed fit but the small was loose in an unflattering way. had the xs been available i might have considered exchanging for an xs but the s was already a bit short on me. (strange because although i am not petite, i am fairly short wasted.) i also wasn't in love with the neckline. i will continue my search for a weekend-w"
"Very nice top, fits true to size, a little short buy looks nice with jeans or work pants"
It's short and wide. not a good combo for anyone who isn't stick thin.
"I wish i had read all the reviews before purchasing. the sweater looked liked everything i would be interested in online. once i pulled it out of the bag, my first thought was how could retailer send me a used, washed and shrunken sweater. it is nothing like the picture. it fits like a midriff top, not exaggerating. i'm 5.6, ordered the m, don't waste your shipping money on this."
I purchased this sweater in a small . nothing on the web site states it has dolman sleeves! it looked sloppy and made my bust disappear! it went back i hate dolman sleeves.
Love this t-shirt. the weight is great for the impending heat and humidity of summer. it looks positively fabulous for casual occasions with pilcro chinos in moss and fuchsia suede pumps.
Cute top but started disintegrating after two washes. the delicate cutouts in the top tore apart. i machine washed it in the gentle cycle and didn't use the dryer. disappointed to have to discard the top after just buying it.
I purchased the yellow and i am quite happy. it matches a lot of things that i already own. nice summer tee.
"I bought the ""here comes the sun"" version of this shirt. i had to have it. i'm a cervical cancer survivor who is still dealing with some health issues. i recently attended a cancer survivor event where a women talked about her life with cancer. she said that you no longer counts the years of her life, instead she counts her sunny days. i was inspired to do the same. so, i love this shirt. i got it on sale, but it still could've been cheaper."
"I received this as a gift. it is a very pretty top, but the material is sooo delicate that the cutout areas were torn in many spots and where it wasn't torn completely you could see it fraying. the sales associate said they get many returns on this item."
"Love this tee! lightweight, airy and comfy. i think it fits true to size. so soft and summery. can't wait to wear it this summer!"
"This is much more a blouse than a ""tee"". the detailing is beautiful and the fabric on the back is a more stuff, starched cotton, not stretchy jersey. because of that i felt like this top ran small. i had to size up."
"I tried this on today and i wish i had taken it home. for me it was true to size, and the star print was perfect. flowy but not in maternity way at all. i'm gonna have to go back for this one!"
"This runs way big.  i would recommend sizing down at least one size.  possibly 2.

i got the design with divers.  it's fun and light for summer.  soft material and very comfy."
"Although i love the soft feel of the sweater, the zig zag design was very unflattering. also, the length is much shorter than appears in the picture. i will be returning it."
"Wished this had worked for me! however, i prefer smaller armholes so my bra and skin (not so young anymore) don't show. the beige lining shows at the armholes as well. on the upside, it's very slimming even with the stiff petticoat. so cute! perfect length for me. another caveat -- if your back is not completely symmetrical, as mine isn't, the decorative back straps sit in a wonky position. i'm 98 lbs, 4' 10"", and the oop was perfect but for the above objections."
"The retailer store by me only carried these in the petites, but i've learned to always snag a petite just to see because sometimes the petites fit just as well, if not better, depending on the length of the outfit!
______________
pros:
- looks exactly the same in person as online. color runs true.
- well made, good stitching, solid dress.
- great length in the sleeves.
- fits tts. i'm normally a size 10 or 12 and grabbed the 12p to see how it'd fit. other than being too short in length on my"
"Love the diving beauty version, it is charming without being too ""cutsie"" which i stay away from. the epitome of summer and that grab and go easy little statement. i find it runs true to size...you could safely size down if need be. love it! thinking of getting the here comes the sun too! tuck it in, tie it in the back or side or great just draping...love the little touch on the sleeve too...nice surprise!"
"This is great. on the model it looks largish, but on me it doesn't. if you're curvier like me (5'10"", 155, 32e) it may be more fitted. long arms with great wrists. design is just as shown. not a sturdy piece. but not cheap looking in any way. i plan to hand-wash and not drop coffee down the front so i can wear it for a long time. just what i want to wear on certain days, and more colors would be great. thanks, retailer."
This is a really flattering tee for my curves. pretty lace details. i purchased the gray and ordered the wine. the pink looked more peach to me in the store. only reason for 4 stars is that the back material wrinkles easily. true to size (large) for me.
"Comfortable material, fits true to size, love the color and can wear all year round. selected this dress for a fall wedding and its a keeper!"
I stumbled across this dress at the store and fell in love. it's so bright and cheery but still sophisticated enough for most events. i love that the tulle that gives the skirt a slight flare and body is completely concealed. the dress is well lined and darling. i am small chested so i didn't have an issue with it feeling revealing nor did the lining hang out. i purchased this for my rehearsal and rehearsal dinner for my summer wedding. i look forward to wearing the dress many times after.
"I""m not crazy about maxi dresses so when i found this fun print with fringe-it spoke my language. love this dress. feel this dress will work with many seasons. dress falls nicely and feels comfortable. i was worried it would be too long but with a 2 inch heel-its perfect. have paired it with some red dangled earrings that spice it just right."
"For the price of this dress, i was expecting something decent. the style is cute, but nothing more. however, the type of the polyester that the dress is made of.... oh my. it is a thick unpleasant material, that will cling to a body when it is hot. i never came across an item at retailer that was made this cheaply.
the tag on the back was hanging at half and the button on the front was ready to come off before i even tried this dress on.
no need to say - it's going back asap.
you should not sel"
"I have been wanting this sweater and decided to order. when i received it, there was no tag on the product. it was not in a typical clear bag from retailer and it wasn't packaged nicely. it came from reno, nv. most products i order do not get shipped from there. it is short, and i'm 5'1"". most clothes that are short fit me with no problem. this sweater might hit me at the waist, or maybe shorter. i think the color is nice and the sweater is soft but not what i wanted. i am going to return it"
"Fantastic signature retailer styling with this unique statement sweater. the pattern placement has a slimming look on the front and a rear enhancing look from behind. i've been using the super soft removable fur collar as a scarf and stole for my other outfits as well. the length is almost tunic on me, so it looks great with leggings and skinny jeans while buttoned up. if you choose to remove the fur collar the v-neck is very open, so i keep it unbuttoned when i style it that way. knit fabric is s"
I purchased this dress for my bridal shower and it was perfect! the details on it are amazing-delicate and lovely! i am 5'11'' and it hit just above my ankles which i loved because i could show off my shoes!
"I love the style of this dress and the color is beautiful and very much like the photo. like previous reviewers mentioned, the top is a little loose in comparison to the bottom. i originally bought a size 4 but then exchanged it for a 2. i tend to be between those sizes. the 2 fits great on bottom but the straps are a bit loose. it might be better for bigger busted ladies!"
"I bought the design which has now sold out, of the sailboats and waves along the top. the t-shirt is super soft and thin. but, it's not sheer or see-through. very light and cool for hot humid summer days. has some nice stretch as well. a really gentle cotton knit.

this top does run large. maybe that's so it will be cool and not stick to you? thus, i didn't size down because i don't like clothes too form-fitting on super hot days."
Overall i really like this dress. the color is vibrant & unique. the top of the dress especially the shoulder straps seem loose so i'm getting it tailored.
Bought this in green at my local store and fell in love with it! i also tried one in pink and it was a bit sheer which is why i opted for the green color instead. very nice and feminine.
"Very cute dress but the skirt flares out more than it looks in the picture. this made my midsection look unflattering from the side. also, for some who is on the flat chested side, you need a good bra or alteration (at least for me). despite what i listed above, i kept the dress since it's a versatile dress for many occasions."
"I just couldn't resist this dress! it's blue, it's fun, it's feminine. the color is so vivid and beautiful in person. i was worried that the length would be an issue (i bought a regular size instead of my normal petite), but i feel that it is perfect. it fits great, and i know i will wear it a lot this summer."
"Great fit, perfect length! so happy with these jeans. the fabric is pretty stretchy but definitely still has a denim feel. very soft - love these jeans!"
"I bought this top at my local retailer in a burgundy color. it is so beautiful and feminine. i want to get it in the other color they had in the store and also this black one available on-line. i bought it in a size 6 and i am 5' 2"" , 34d. i sometimes get tops in petite but i felt the reg size fit just fine."
I purchased this item as a gift for my wife and she loves it. the quality for the price is great. soft and comfortable. needs to be washed with care but is worth it
"Gorgeous fun dress, but the cut in the armholes (6 petite) is really low. so low even a strapless bra peeks above it. there are also lining issues (could have been with just my one choice) where the lining is not stitched well around the armholes so it shows too much. back is stunning. i would say that if you can go bra less this could be so awesome. it didn't work for my body because i have to wear a bra, but i think its a winner for someone."
"I kept the size 8 of the dress and had to return the 10 as it was too roomy at the arms and chest (which is great!!!). material is nice and not too much material, hangs nice (its a swing). another win!"
"Many compliments - great color and so comfy. most of my dresses from retailer are maeve brand, and i have never been disappointed."
Tts and very very sleek and flattering. just love for summer. nice light weight. feel great on and not saggy. nice color addition since my other favorite are lighter shade of blue.
"I really love this this dress, but i agree with the previous reviewer about the belt around the waist-it is a draped piece of fabric that is very figure flattering where it wraps, but one side of the dress has no belt and it shows muffin tops/bulges.i would have loved this if the belt went all the way around. one other point i would like to make is that bra straps are hard to conceal. i bought this dress because of the gorgeous color, but ended up returning it because of the belt and bra strap i"
This is by far the most comfortable bra i've ever owned. i love the convertible strap feature. it's great for shirts with a back cutout.
"This top runs small across the top. i was amazed at the material--polyester, i am sure--because the price was so high. it has a sheer layer underneath, which i think would make it hot in the summer. i love this kind of tank but it just did not look as good as it does online."
Love this dress. the fabric is super soft and flowy. be aware that the model is a tall gal.... i'm usually a size 8/10 in dresses and purchased a large. returned it for a large petite as it went way past my knees. looks funny if it is below the knee. the petite is perfect.
"I bought this tank in the blue popsicle print, and i think it's cuter in person than it is online. the beautiful pastel colors on the popsicles really stand out and make it special. i am normally a size 4-6, and the small fits me perfectly. also, i appreciate that it's lined. i wore it with skinnies, and received lots of compliments. it's the perfect tank for summer!"
"Very pretty but also very roomy. i'm using it as a swimsuit cover up, so it's perfect!"
"I ordered these in my typical size, 26, and they fit everywhere perfectly except the butt. for me, i found them to be too tight in that area. i went to the store and tried on the 27 and they were too big in the waist. i do recommend them though. they are well made, i loved the wash and the length was perfect. being 5'3"" they came to the lower ankle and that was fine with me. give them a try, hopefully they work better for you."
"I tried on the xs in the store (115 lbs, 30dd chest, short). fit: i think it is a little big, i would tend to go for a xxs petite in this for me, the length was ok, but would look more flattering in petite. also, the waist was on the looser side. the green color is amazing though, very flattering and springy/summery. the flow of the dress is also very nice. the weird thing is the belt at the waist, it starts a little off from the seam, and doesn't go all the way around, not sure if i love it or"
"This well made chemise is figure flattering and just the right length for me (5'2""). i would wear it as a slip or a nightie. looking forward to wearing it!"
"This is just a fantastic dress! i bought it in my usual m in the blue and it fits like a glove. i love the varying lengths and the adorable sleeves and the substantial knit which feels amazing on the body without revealing any bumps and lumps :) i took the regular length and found it perfect. the front hits about two inches above my knee and the rest hits a bit lower. i'm only 5""1, but i prefer dresses that hit closer to my knee than mini so the regular was perfect for me
definitely a keeper!"
"This dress is perfection it is extremely comfortable and versatile. great for dressing up or down. i am large busted (36g) so was delighted that it stretches as this is a problem for me finding clothing to fit allover. i am petite 5""1 with a curvy figure and a regular medium fit great!"
"I ordered this in the ""plum"" color, which in real life just looks like a very, very dark brown. that would probably be okay, but the dress is actually about 3 inches shorter than the listed measurements. i ordered the regular length, but the shortest part of the hem hits me only about halfway down my thigh...way, way too short. i am 5'5"", for reference. lastly, i think the fabric is just awful quality, especially for this price point. the slight texture makes it want to cling to itself - worn ou"
The price is high and i have to dry clean this? no thanks.
"This is a great summer maxi dress. i am 5'4"" 120lbs, about a size 4 in dresses, 32dd. i got this in an extra small. i was really happy that on someone my height, it's just a few inches above my ankle, so did not shorten me at all. the straps were a good length, and the waist hit at the right spot. i don't think the waist detail not going all the way around is a big deal, there are the little snaps in the straps for your bra, and skirt is lined. the turquoise color is really pretty and the fabric"
"This dress had so much promise from the picture. i loved the midi length, color, and fascinating waist detail. i ordered online, so there was no way to try on before purchasing. the fit was disappointing. it fell in an unflattering manner at every point; a tad too low at the waist; a tad too long at the shin. just kind of saggy all around. bummed, but this is not to say it wouldn't fit someone with a different body shape better. the quality of fabric is nice, and the color is lovely."
This dress is super comfortable and the material is so soft. the fit is very flattering and will cover any imperfections if you are heavier and want to hide anything. its more fitted in the top and drapes on the body very nicely. the hem is asymmetrical and the highest part of the hem hits about 2 inches above my knee and i am 5'3.'' i will wear this with tights for work. color is very nice also.
"Dress is very pretty, but very short, almost tunic length."
"I love this dress!!! it's comfortable, flattering and stylish. looks great with flats or boots - awesome with a chunky scarf and tights."

"I loved this dress on way more than i expected to - the pictures don't do it justice. the fabric is soft and is a really nice weight - heavier than i expected, which makes the dress hang in a really flattering way. the belt doesn't go all the way around, as other reviewers said, but i actually kind of like it that way. i almost didn't try it on based on some of the other reviews, but i'm sooooo glad i did. it's a really cute dress - will look great as is, or with a light cardigan if it's a littl"
"I like the style, but i ordered an extra small (i am5'4' 120#) and it was still too loose fitting on me, had to return, hopefully exchange for xxs"
"I ordered a regular size xs and the length is still fine for me at 5'2"". i love the color and the fabric is super soft and comfortable. i'll get a lot of use out of it this summer and the sale price is a great bargain!"
"I'm a big fan of paige jeans. these are perfect for my petite frame. at 5""3' they were ankle length. i tried my normal paige size and ultimately sized up for a better fit at the waist."
This top is oversized. i normally wear large but thought an xl would be best for sleeping. it's huge. so stick with your normal size or a size down. pretty print. fabric is a bit coarse. undecided about trying a size down because i'm particular and they didn't wow me. also ordered these in the lighter color and they fit the same.
"This is, like many reviewers stated, a very flattering and nice dress. the sleeves were particularly great, because they are slightly longer than most of this type and went past the meaty (for lack of a better word!) part of my arm, only exposing the slimmer bits. it looked great on me, and i imagine it would on most people. i just did not like the handkerchief hem....too young, too trendy? i don't know, when you're in your 40s, you start to feel ridiculous in certain styles! i just didn't feel"
I am so glad i tried this dress on. it is so chic and beautiful! perfect for an evening out or during the day. i can't believe the price!
"I'm a big retailer buyer- and usually love the dresses, especially the petite xs maxis. this was the worst retailer purchase i have ever made. 

it was humongous and gave me no shape. even if i purchased an xxsp it probably would be the same. i'm small but i mean come on- this would only fit a giantess-- which also makes no sense because it's the petite size. 

do not buy. i'm very upset i have to pay the $5.95 return fee since i ordered this."
"The dress is just ok. i cannot imagine having paid full price for this. i got it for florida vacation. i put it on to wear to church first and spilled a drop of lavender oil on it and it stained!!!! cant get it out. thats punk for a dress that even on sale is like. 
sending back"
"I tried this on in store and was very close to purchasing, but ultimately decided against it because it was too in between causal and dressy to me. i couldn't imagine where i would wear the dress. it was great quality and the green color was very pretty on. you could find a way to wear a bra with the dress."
I love this! i will sport it in the spring with white capris/ leggings and awesome for a beach cover-up! the fit is comfy the embroidery gives it a feminine touch. i purchased the large but could've gotten away with a slender fit in medium. i am 5'4 170 lbs.
"I loved this dress and purchased it in my usual m. however, i agree with another reviewer that it is too long for me at least, so i returned this and will buy it in petite instead. if you are shorter (i'm 5'2), the regular length doesn't fall right, the shorter front section falling right at the knee and the longer section falling halfway on my calf . but great style! looking forward to seeing it on me in the petite."
Love! highly recommend...usually i wait for sale price but this was worth the extra splurge. so flattering!
"This is a great dress for all body types. the fabric is substantial and soft.  i sized down for a closer fit, but i could have also bought my usual medium and had the extra space to belt it and wear a looser fit. i busted out the boots, a little early, and the outfit was done.  super easy to wear, dressed up or dressed down.  totally worth the price, i'm glad i didn't wait until it went on sale for fear of selling out."
"Looks fitted on, but this just turned out to be an oversized muumuu on. the fabric also felt cheap."
"This is a solid well made transistional dress going from late summer to fall. i'm 5'7"" and got the medium and it falls a little above my knee. i could see it being very flattering on many body types. i do think you need to accessorize the dress as it is on the bland side. i bought the plum/brown color and am very happy with it."
"Perfection! i am 5'3""/108 and the size 25 fit me like a glove. beautiful color too!! highly recommend!!"
"Thrilled that this not only fits great on me but i got it at a deep sale price!  all the problems that the negative reviewers had did not apply to me at all.  i'm so glad i gave this a try.  my body is large on top with a square waist, a bit of a tummy, no hips or bum and the medium petite skimmed over all my flaws and made me look more proportionate.  not sure why this is called halter though.  i am 5'3"" 36dd, wide torso, size 28 jeans, 140#."
"Love the style of this dress (length, hem, waist details, material)! i think it looks best on curvy women due to the waist detail only going part way around. it doesn't give the entire waist definition, which is why it would look best on someone who has a naturally defined waist. this is a pretty unique dress, which is one of the reasons i liked it. i agree with one of the previous reviewers about it being hard to conceal your bra straps. unfortunately for me that is a deal breaker because i rea"
"So i got this on sale and the only size they had was a xs petite. i didn't have my hopes very high but i thought i would give it a shot. the dress came today and it fit great. i am 5""6"" so the petite came just above my knees but the dress is still adorable. the material and cut is great. this is not what i was looking for but it is a welcome addition."
This dress is beautiful. it is longer than it looks on the model (i'm 5/5) but drapes beautifully. it is perfect for a wedding or a special event. i love it!
"I have mixed feelings about this dress. the color is fantastic. not too bright, not too dark. the material is super soft and comfortable and the length was perfect. i did end up returning this item though as no matter which bra i chose, the straps showed. it just was not hitting my right on the shoulders. i do not like having my bra straps show or constantly be trying to tuck them away (especially at a wedding or work?). this is what ultimately led me to return the dress ? even though it is beau"
"This dress is super soft and really flattering. i'm 5'2"" and i tried a regular size m in the store and hated it on me, but decided to order a petite m and give it a try and i love it. it's one i've been wearing a lot with ankle boots and all sorts of jackets. it's great for these fall days that are still warm-ish. would be really cute with tights."
"This cover up has great potential. i love the embroidery. the colors and design are great. however, it has a number of loose strings. it makes me wonder what might happen when i wash it. the fabric is on the thinner side, but it is not see through. the fabric would be nice for a hot day by the pool. i caught it on sale, so i am keeping it."
"The design of this dress is darling and so unique, and it's very well made. but i agree it's very boxy and overwhelming for a petite frame. i'm 5'3"" and ordered the 2, and it was like wearing a hospital gown. if a petite were available i'd have tried that, but this one's going back. shame, too, because it's adorable. the gap in the neckline could easily be stitched or sewn shut, but that's an inconvenience when this dress is already priced so high."
"I love the cut and aesthetic of this shirt, but the fabric unfortunately shows even the slightest hint of sweat, which makes it difficult to wear without being self conscious"
Despite other reviewers comments on size - i really wanted this one to work so i ordered it. i'm typically a size xs and d chest and instead i ordered a small. the body of the sit for well but the cups of the suit i'd said for more for a b. (if i lifted my arms i would literally come out of it)
Love the sweater. the knit has a rich look and the fit is perfect. i paired it with a printed pencil skirt for an eclectic look. strongly recommend to your wardrobe.

"This is a nice shirt, but i can't keep it. i ordered a 0 and i do have an athletic build with somewhat wider shoulders given how petite i am (usually wear 00 petite in all pants) and i think this size was perfect (fit across the back perfectly) when you lift your arms the way it is cut makes it really tight across the chest and shows your stomach. at the same time, the high low styling makes for a really strange shirt-tail in the back. i'm sure this is the trend but it really does not look cute"
"I'm a 32-a, and i bought a small. i found that the tube portion is pretty tight, but probably needed to keep things up. because there is not a clasp in the front or back, it is really hard to get in and out of. i'd probably be ok with it, but the cups were too big for me. i think i would need to be a c to fill it.
the quality is really nice and the molded cups are a good shape. i wish i could have made it work, because it was really comfortable. i returned it in the end."
"Hi ladies,
does this bra take a contortionist to put it on the first time? yes. did my boyfriend laugh at me hysterically while i tried to get it over the girls? yes. however, i am a large chested girl 34d, i bought the large and this is honestly the absolute best, most comfortable, amazing, non hurting/poking best strapless bra i have ever owned. i just bought three more, just in case the first two wear out. i love this, i love how far it comes down on the sides, i love that it doesn't slip do"
"I just got this in the mail & had to immediately write a review. i love it!. i took a risk & ordered the xxs, which i assume is a 00. it fits me perfectly so i would say it runs large. i'm a true dress size 2 but usually wear a 0 or xs in us sizing. the shoulder length from seam to seam is about 14 inches. i'm 32c-24-34. hope this helps!"
"This shirt feels so nice, it's heavier weight and so soft.. i think it's lyocel... such a great drape to the shirt that is so flattering. i am 5'8'' 128lbs and 34c/d and purchased a size 4. found this item to be true to size, if not slightly loose, but i love the flow of it. highly recommend, the green is classic and timeless, very versatile."
"Love it! the light blue is a gorgeous color. i thought this might be more chambray, but i'm happy it's not. it's also stitched at the top so no awkward accidental peep show or need for annoying tape."
"Love this top! i bought it last month in the olive green color and love it. great quality fabric, comfortable and can be dressed up or down."
"This bra runs very small, and is hard to get on and off. i think if i went a size up i would be happier."
"I was so excited to receive this top but was immediately disappointed! it is much thinner than it seems & it almost feels like a cheap top. it's also see-through but i'm not bothered by that. it has a very boxy cut which i like with slimmer bottoms. but overall, i didn't care for this top & expected it to be more structured & stiff rather than flimsy & thin. it's going back..."
You have to be a contortionist to get this bra on. it slips over your head and i needed my 8yo daughter to help me pull it down past my elbows. ridiculously impractical. why oh why didn't heather give it a hook and loop closure instead?
"I love this top, i dress it up when i need to be more professional and i dress it down with a pair of cutoffs when it's warm. it is delicate, however, so i try not to wash it too frequently. the front is a bit boxy, which the model demonstrates. the model really encompasses the crisp whiteness of the shirt, the flow of it and the length."
Great fit and design but the wool is too itchy and rough. will need a layer underneath
"This was going to be my go to top. i loved the look of the billowy shirt, especially in light blue. when it arrived, i knew it wouldn't work for my body. i'm athletic build with muscular upper arms and a d cup. i tried it on anyway. i really wish it fit. it was snug in the upper arms and pulled a bit in the front. i knew if i ordered a size up the arms would still be tight. it's just the cut of the shirt. this top is best for someone that isn't busty and has slender upper arms."
"While there us no clasp and this bra does require you to pull it over your head, i did not find it to be too difficult. i love that the bra stays in place and that i do not have to constantly pull it up throughout the day! it's quite comfortable too. i wish i had ordered the same bra with the straps too before they sold out of my size!"
"Slighty fitted, flattering, very soft and not itchy. the orange is a very nice color."
"I was looking for an oversized silhouette but this is more like a beach cover-up. the waist does not have elastic or any structure. the top fabric is crossed over but not sewn closed, and because the fit is so loose it just gaps open. the fabric is nice quality but i am returning."

"I got tons of compliments when i wore this top out a couple weeks ago. it is a little bit shorter than i thought, and a little bit loose (not ""baggy"" but just kind of hangs). if you have a larger chest, this may not be super-flattering. the color is really pretty and looked great with dark skinnies. i bought my normal size (after trying on a size down, which was just too short...and i'm 5'2)"
I loved the color and the style of the sleeves.  it was a bit too short on me and i thought it made me look boxy so i didn't end up keeping it
Saw this on the sale rack and decided to try on. i looked like the dancing hypos in the movie fantasia. i am petite and not heavy but this is for very slim and tall people. too much fabric in the peplum part.
This product is comfortable and stylish. i love the design and the color print. i can dresss it up and dress it down. it goes with everything and also fits great.
I got these on sale a few months ago. they are the most comfortable jeans i've ever owned. i'm 5'4 and they are the perfect length for me but i like my jeans a little long.
"I had this dress in my basket for a long tiem waiting for free shipping. i liekd how it looked on the model. read the reviews, and wasn't sure, so waited... then my usual size sold out, so i decided ot try the smaller size (in petites, otherwsie i would have gotten it in the store :_)) i needed pettie and the smaller size is perfect! the color says black, but it looks more mifnight (aka blue), my friend even said (when i tried it on), you know i laways love anything blue... so don't expect dark"
Love this top for the fall. looks great with dark skinny jean and booties.
Love this design it puts a twist on a turtle neck sweater. the only problem i had is that the tie kept coming undone but if you do a double knot the problem is solved! wish i would have bought all the other colors.
"I tried these in store, didn't have much hope as flare usually looks terrible on me (small waist and athletic, fuller legs). but surprisingly these work great. they seem to very good quality and the flare is super cute and on trend. i do think they run a little small. i am almost always a 2/26, but i took these in a 4. they didn't have a 2 in store for me to compare but i think they would have been too tight. highly recommend!"
Runs a size big unless you want it really boxy. felt the matl was flimsy and would prob pill soon. turquoise was a pretty color but returning this one.
"I ordered these because i loved the wide cut and overall look. but returned them because they fit weird. too tight around the too high waistline (and normally, i like a high waistline). fit ran small. and the overall quality of the fabric wasn't as nice as i was hoping for. pretty disappointed."
"I wanted this tank to work so badly! it was a great deal and so beautiful. unfortunately the top fitted portion ends right below my chest then the shirt flares out so i looked like a cupcake. my belly also showed slightly because the shirt is short. if you have a short torso, this would work great. if not, unfortunately, its not great - tear"
"I am 5'8 with curvy, muscular body and 36ddd boobs. the ruffle ends up hitting me right below my breasts and creates the look of being about 6 months pregnant. the beading is beautiful and i wish that it fit."

The sweater coat would be wonderful for cooler weather this fall. i ordered it in medium because the small sizes were sold out. sometimes a medium is the right size depending on the brand. i was disappointed that the coat was so large; i don't think it will work for me even with layers underneath. it's a great design but i may have to return it.
"Love these pants!!! retailer - please sell more colors and patterns of these! i have a hard time finding work pants that fit right, don't have to be hemmed (i'm 5'3"") and aren't boring. this is just enough pattern to be interesting, but still neutral enough to pair with other things. i bought them full price and would happily do so again for another pattern!"
"I agree with the other reviews that these jeans run big. for my body, straight up and down, i ordered 2 sizes down, but would have ordered one size down had i been able to try them on in the store. the jeans i received were lighter, not blue, and more grey with very noticeable white whiskering. i need a new pair of jearns and i love the cut of these so i am keeping this pair, but, for me, because of the color they are just ok compared to the wow i was expecting from the picture."
This is a very well made top. i love everything about this top! bought it in both colors. i think it's fancy enough to wear out at night or in the daytime with shorts and flip flops. i got it on sale but would have totally paid regular price for it!
"I wish i hadn't waited so long to buy this! the smalls were sold out in grey by the time i finially did, but the medium ended up being totally fine. perfect for a warmer winter, it is pretty thin so i wouldn't trust it on it's own to keep you warm in cold weather, but easily could be layered! i love the fun aspect of the tie front for this sweater as the front tuck is becoming a little tired in my eyes. i love that you can make it shorter or longer or even tuck it in because the ties aren't sewn"
Love this sweater. i have it in cream and ordering navy. it is comfortable and looks great with pants or a skirt. i do not like my sweaters tight so i have a large and love the fit. i am 5' 4'' and weigh 135 and usually buy medium to large.
I love this! seriously would buy again. i wish it was warmer out so i could wear it
"I love this top. it is very short and hits at a potentially unflattering area if one has wider hips. the fabric and swing to the ""skirt"" is adorable."
"I have a small collection of retailer pants for work, and this pair fit neatly into a hole-- i don't have a fun, patterned pair. i am short (5'2"") and definitely needed a petite to get the crop to land in the right spot. my usual 0p fit perfectly up above. the flare seems a bit more pronounced on me than in the picture. the fabric is nice quality, smooth and medium weight with a bit of stretch, and i like the fact that these are machine washable. this gal has other things to do with her life besid"
"This jacket runs very large. i usually wear an xl but probably could fit into a medium. i have long arms, and the sleeves were way past my hands. i love the jacket, but it's just too sloppy."
"I wanted to like this top so so so so badly. so badly in fact, that after the first size didn't fit, i ordered two other sizes to make sure: xl, l, m. none of them worked i really wanted to like this top. the online photo makes the clothing look so flattering and the shirt is just not....at least on me. the shirt online on the model looks slimming and a lot longer than the actual piece of the clothing. the beaded work is very beautiful, but short causing the very poofy peplum to start at the mos"
I love these pants so much i even paid full price for them.  i'm going to order them in navy too.  super cute fit.  cute with flats or heels.
"I followed the advice of other reviewers and sized down. however, the jacket was still too large. it fit fine in the arms but the body/width of the jacket was huge. also i found the wool material to be extremely itchy. it might work if you are layering it over long sleeves but still make sure to size down at least one or maybe even two sizes."
"I stumbled upon this by accident and i thought the turquoise color looks unique so i tried it on, and it was a great fit first time around. i dislike open shoulder blouses because most of them are too open but this one is very sutble which gives it a girl next door sexy look. the material is very soft, the pattern is subtle plaid, and the liner is a plus. size 2 regular fits me very comfortably (i'm 5'2"", 34b, 26 waist, 36 hips). i could size down more but i like the relaxed look like on the mod"
"Gorgeous colors on lovely silk skirt. longer on me than in photo, but i'm only 5'4"". i usually wear a size 12 or 32"" waist jeans, but i could not zip up the large. by several inches. i'm not sure if i can possibly cover the waist and still wear it that way. sad because i've had my eye on this for months:("
"Absolutely beautiful - 
usually don't leave reviews here, but this top (material, beading, style) is so gorgeous i would be remiss if i didn't. i have a short torso, so the peplum hit me above the belly-button. it's very voluminous, but with the right pants and heels, it is a perfect outfit. as a full-time student, i'm apt to find retailer expensive - but this purchase was so very much worth it. in terms of sizing- i initially got the s to accommodate my bust (30f) but preferred the xs."
Very cute! waist is a little big for me but overall a pretty good fit.
"Beautiful dress with the colors and pleats. i did not have the same problems with the bust area that others did. my biggest complaint is the exposed zipper doesn&#39;t lay flat, even when just hanging on the hanger. when actually on a person the zipper juts out. had to be returned!"
"Tried this on and loved it! chic, lightweight, warm, cute left as is and cuter belted. ended up letting a friend buy it since it was the last one but will be adding to my iso list for sure!"
"I have to confess i had very high hopes for this dress. i was buying it as a stylish, modern alternative to a business suit. i wanted this dress to work as a piece to deliver presentations in or attend faculty functions. tailored, conservative, and edgy at the same time. several hundred dollars dress should meet the aforementioned needs, i thought. but it did not. the best description for the dress is ""blah"", average.

the material is textures and crinkly, not slick. the top is cream/ivory color"
"I love this shirt! i was surprised by the other reviews. it's boxy, but not unflattering. i get so many compliments on this. a steal for the price."
"It's rare to find such a great skirt -- flattering, unique design, substantial (denim-like) fabric, something with pockets! this skirt has everything, including an adjustable buckled waist. i love the slight a-line shape, too. for me it fits true to size (the same size i wear in skirts from other brands). i love the colors -- ivory background, cobalt, periwinkle, orange, blush pink, yellow, black. it will be easy to pair with tees or button-down shirts and cute sandals."
"I really liked this top when i tried it on but as i wore it the bottom of the sleeves stretched out terrible where they looked worn out from wearing over and over, and since this happened with the first wearing and i paid $88.00 i sent it back. if it hadn't been for that it's a comfy and cute casual top"
"This skirt fits my curves so well. the adjustable waist is so helpful for getting the perfect fit. it sits high on me, but i have a very long torso so that didn't bother me and actually made the length more flattering for my shorter legs. the colors are vibrant and versatile."
"I know this product description says oversized but that's an understatement. i ordered a small and tried it on and i looked like a little kid in their father's jacket. i don't even think an xs would have worked. i'm 5'6"" and about 135 pounds for reference. i will say that the embroidery on the back is very cool and this jacket is overall a cool concept but it's just way too big."
"Agreed with the previous reviewer, this is the same dress as the evanthe dress that came out this summer, but in a rich beautiful red/wine color. the color differences in the pattern are , however, more subtle than the summer version, remaining in one palette. yo u can't tell from the picture, but the back is longer than the front. the neckline is very flattering, i found this one a little more snug than the evanthe (around the rib cage), tried on 00p (size for evanthe) might be better as 0p in"
"I bought three of these this summer--a mint, ivory, and yellow. when i received them, they looked nice enough in person. i liked the heart motif and the peplum. the problem is the knit was on the cheap side and stretched out. the arms were tighter than i liked but loosened up through the day. but, then the look became more matronly. i wish they had been 3/4 length or a vest. the cheap, outstretched look just didn't work. i ended up donating all of mine after a few wears. they also pilled conside"
"Ordered this top online, color is a little more gray than green but it is gorgeous, comfortable and flattering, so much so, i am ordering the navy too. great quality , fabulous with jeans ."
"I love this blouse! the colors of the little sunglasses are vibrant against the black background, the buttons on the front are also a coral/peach color and beautifully made. its thin enough to be worn in the summer or fall without making you sweat or freeze. i ordered a medium, which i usually wear in most retailer tops and it fits perfectly. i'm a 36b and can run from an 8 to a 10 in tops. i do recommend trying it on before purchasing if you can, especially for women with a larger bust. th"
This is such a beautiful dress.  but have to return for the reasons others have noted.  the chest does not fit well.
"Girls, this dress is gorgeous.  but if you are an a/b cup, there is just too much fabric in the bust.  the entire dress is pleated from the shoulders down, so a curvier figure would be shown to great advantage in this beautiful number.  alas, i had to send it back and was very sad to do so."
"Really wanted this to worked for me. ordered the s in ivory (the color i really wanted but xs was sold out) and the xs in cedar.  loved the knit and look and quality but the sweater was boxy and huge even in xs.  not flattering on my petite frame (5'2"", 115#).  so disappointed as i've been looking for a non-wool sweater like this."
This skirt is pleasantly more dynamic in person. the print and colors are really nice and more vibrant than the photos. the cut was spot on and the fabric seems heavy enough to hide imperfections (but not too heavy...) length as shown on model.
"This top can be dressed up or down, very good quality fabric and colors shown as the photo (blue). i usually wear petite sizes but chose the regular version because i wanted to be able to tuck it in. i think it might be too short otherwise."
Love the color (cedar). love the style. sleeves are long and wide but that is the style. biggest surprise is that this sweater is not cropped. the length given in the product info is very short. but when i received my normal size (l) the sweater comes to my hips. just right. the fibers are man-made (acrylic) so that makes this sweater not too warm and not itchy. the weave is close enough that i do not need to wear a cami underneath. when the weather gets colder i will add a nice cami under the s
"Love everything about it!! chunky, comfortable, lazy day or dress up with a cool necklace!"
I saw this online and loved it. plus after reading the reviews i thought why not. but if you have a big chest beware. i am a 34ddd and a pretty solid medium. the volumous front of the vest added way to much to me and i sized down to a small. had to return.
"Love, love this clever eyeglass print. i bought the black background with bright sunglass print - perfect for pairing with jeans, shorts or a slender skirt."
Exactly as pictured. great fit. love it.
"Absolutely love everything about this sweater. i was hesitant to buy because it's so oversized and i was worried it would overwhelm my small frame. but the xs fits great, i love the large knit look and the bell sleeves. pairing with dark denim skinny jeans helped balance out the sweaters oversized shape. wore it work and then to a party and received compliments on it all day."
I wear this vest two ways - over a long sleeve shirt when it's warmer and layered over a shirt and cardigan when it's cooler. it's the perfect amount of warmth when i'm running errands and don't want to wear a heavy coat. love it and plan to wear it a lot!
"The quality of this vest is outstanding, and the warmth is exceptional. i have worn it as a jacket on milder days, in work as a warmth layer and brought on vacation to act as both plus a bathrobe. it is a very stylist piece that can be worn open or belted. it runs large by style, but i am 5'1"", 100 lbs and i can carry it off."
This vest was of excellent weight but it had very little style. it was like a giant piece of felt was cut out with little thought to design or nuance. not for me.
"I love this skirt! it's a denim material, so it's structured, but not too heavy for warm weather. the colors are bright. it may run a bit big, but i didn't have trouble with my usual size. the pockets are actually usable. great for casual and easy to dress up."
Love the print of this fabric & the length. the buckles at the waist add a unique look so no belt necessary.
"I fell for the charcoal one and bought standard size m/l. on first wearing with slim jeans, booties and a long sleeved t, the body of the vest was fine. but with wavy shoulder-length hair, i found the large, wide collar overwhelming at the top. i tried folding the collar under, as in the photo of the gray one, but still too much. i altered it by paring it down by 7 inches at the back neck, and tapering down to meet the lapel at mid-chest. the fabric looks like boiled wool, but is actually a tigh"
"This jacket is my favorite purchase in a while! i used my last month 50th birthday discount on it!
it is of exceptional materials and quality construction. the juxtaposition of the stripes against the beautifully vibrant embroidery on back is stunning! it does run true to size as it is an oversized piece, which adds to its classy dramatic flare! my size medium came in the european size 38. for reference, i am an american size 8-10. 
it is comfortable to wear and can easily accomodate large ful"
"I loved the colors and the feel of the fabric. it was a lovely dress but it fit weird on my 34 dd chest so back it goes. the zipper had one spot where it was tight, right at the widest part of my rib cage. it was fine every where else. too bad."

"I bought this blouse on sale in a medium because it was the last one left in the store. i usually wear a large, but surprisingly it fit. i'm a woman of color, and the off white and lace looks great with my complexion. i got many compliments on the blouse as i made my way to the register to check out. i can't wait to wear it this spring. i'll have to be careful when wearing this blouse because one good snag with a fingernail, or necklace and the lace will be torn. other than that, i'm very happy"
"These shorts are just beautiful. with that said, they were expensive, but made reasonable when i snagged them in the online sale! they do also run large, and they seem to be made for short-waisted bodies. i will be bringing them back to my local store to (hopefully) exchange for a smaller size. fingers crossed that they still have them in stock!"
I strongly disagree with the previous reviewer. the shirt in our store was featured in all colors.  i chose the burnt orange color to try on and it is was incredibly soft!  i felt like i was wearing a t-shirt with an easy on and easy off feel. the flow of the shirt allows you to wear out or tuck in.  i paired with teal velvet crops and tucked the shirt in for more structure to the outfit. love!!!
Love this sweater. fun for fall. soft fabric and runs true to size. will look great with jeans or dress pants.
The weave is very loose and chunky which i like but isn't so apparent in the picture. also the sleeves bell more than it looks like on the model. the color is a great caramel and it fit tts. i think it will be great on cooler days.
"Love this sweater, do wish i sized up for a little longer length, but works great with high rise pants.  comfy and great color"
"I felt inspired to write a review as soon as i put this on. the vest fits so well, and the thick fabric feels amazing. love the pockets! like the previous reviewer, i feel like i'll be able to wear this with workout clothes or with a dressier outfit. it has an ever so slight racer back, so probably would look weird with sleeveless tops that come all the way to your shoulders, but i can already think about so many ways i want to wear it. the draping in the front also falls really nicely. great bu"
"With my 5'9', hourglass frame, wider hips and having a baby, i wear normally sizes 10/12 (m/l) in most retailer skirts and dresses. however, with this, i was able to fit into an 8; it just sat higher up and was too form fitting for my liking. here are my thoughts:
_________
pros:
- lots of stretch and comfort.
- pockets! always a plus in my book :)
- will go with any top.
- nice length. fit me as in the model.
- very slimming.
- you could probably go down a size if you are slender with not wide hi"
"This is a favulous cape...in fact i would buy another if there were other colors! it is oversized, playful, chic, dramatic and simply put a true statement piece. it will not be flattering to your figure...it is not suppose to...but it will show your true sense of style! wish it had pockets...i may add them for more play."
"I saw this sweater online and had to try it. i went to my local retailer to try it on and i'm glad i did. i am usually a xs - s in tops and i thought this fit best in a medium. it's very chunky which is what i was looking for and so soft - not scratchy at all. it has wide bell sleeves, but that's very on trend right now. i am 5'4, 34b and it falls about an inch below the top of my jeans. it's not form fitting but so snugly. i plan on wearing it with dark denim skinnies, booties, and simple jewlery"
"I ordered a small and it is enormous; i usually wear a size 10. it is short but the fullness in the body and the sleeves made me look like a sumo wrestler. also, it is a very heavy knit which would be great for up north but too bulky for atlanta unless the temps are in the 40s. i'm sending it back."
"These two blouses are probably my best purchases anywhere in some time. fit is perfect, quality is great and both will be worn many times this summer and into the fall. unique from the all other tops i have seen lately."
"This skirt is really cute and versatile, it can be dressed up or down. i paired it with a black chiffon top for a dressed up look and a denim button down for a casual look. the length is good, and the buckles allow it to be tightened, which is a plus if you have an athletic body."
"I adore this sweater. it is so soft and cozy. i ordered two because i really need some good winter sweaters that are forgiving on the pooch but not wool (darn allergies). so i ordered this in the white and black (camel is a bad color for me).

tried on the first sweater when they arrived and it was so comfy i didn't want to take it off. then i looked in the mirror. i'm a tall gal, 5' 11"" with broad shoulders and i weigh about 165, and this sweater was so unflattering! it just made me look big"
"I saw the skirt on a display today at my local store. i was attracted by the colors and the display itself. my thoughts, "" give it a chance"". i bought the size 10 without even trying it on, with the idea that the colors and style had so much potential, i am so pleased with this skirt! the fit is true, although if you like a higher ride on the waist, i would size down. the fabric has just the right amount of stretch to make it super comfortable. i had so many staple items in my wardrobe that i wi"
"This shirt is exactly what i expected! it is just as cute as on the website and the fit was great! it's the perfect shirt for summer, loose fitting but in a flattering way. the design makes it very versatile since it can be matched with so many colors!

i highly recommend it!"
"The colors of this dress are beautiful and i really wanted to love it but it wasn't cut for my body shape. i think you either need to be curvy to fill out the chest or straight up&down to have it lay flat (as in the model). ordered size 6: 34b, 150 5' 9"", tall/slim build. i also think the hi/lo hem of the dress isn't well indicated in the pictures; i'm not a fan of the style and was hoping it would be minimal however the hem is definitely asymmetric."
This is really cute - it has a boxy look and bell-like sleeves. the knit is chunky and so very soft. i didn't want to take it off. i purchased an xs in black. it's gorgeous. my beige bra shows through so i will need to wear black or a camp underneath. it feels really heavy - in a good way - and it feels like it will be really warm. the black has a velvety look to it. i'm smitten. i should also mention that it did feel cropped to me - i know i read other reviews that said it wasn't cropped. i fee
"Lovely knit and so soft, but the bottom curls up underneath, similar to the bell sleeves. runs oversize too, got xs and it's too bulky and unflattering since the bottom doesn't lay flat. returned!"
"I saw the black in store and had to try on. it is very, very cute. i would say it fits a bit small. i tried my usual medium and while it fit, it was a little short. id take you could take your regular size or size up. i would not size down in this one. adding to my wish list and hoping it sticks around til sale time!"
"Let it be known that i hate shopping for jeans. i recently had my go-to skinny jeans rip by my back pocket and new i needed to get something new & better stat. i have a pair of black ag sateens that i got a few years ago, and i decided to try out this pair. i got them in the mail yesterday, and i never want to part with them! they are perfection. they hit perfectly on my waist; they're incredibly comfortable and basically make you feel like you're wearing the jean equivalent to yoga pants. they"
"Was scared at first to order this product, when i tried it on i was amazed on how good it looks. fits just like the model picture, and the material is awesome."
"Great dress! wish it came it more colors, would like to buy another one. i am 5'5"",125, size small is perfect. unlike one of the previous reviewers, i do not think it is too clingy. maybe she needed to size up.very versital, cute with a jean jacket, or long lightweight scarf, booties, or sandals! ."
"This dress is perfect for spring and early summer. it has some weight to it and so it drapes beautifully. it is very well made and the fabric is good quality. the color is a medium color gray; much prettier than in the picture. i wear a small in most retailer dresses and this fit perfectly in a small. it hugs in all the right places and skims from the hips just like in the picture.. the length was just as it looked on the model. i am 5' 5""."
This is such a unique and fun dress. i'm so glad i found it and it fits perfectly!
"I've passed this dress by a number of times online, but ordered it on a whim on the mothers day promo. based on the reviews, i ordered my regular size, medium. it fit perfectly. i do think the cut is on the trim side, but it isn't tight or fitted. i probably couldn't eat a big meal in this though as it would probably show in this dress. the fabric is buttery soft! the button placket down the front is very clean and lays flat. there are two side pleats that are a different fabric and are ever so"
"What a unique twist on the traditional cargo jacket! the swing styling on this jacket is so cute---not too full-, you still get a nice silhouette from the front, with the swing in the back this is a fresh take on this staple. it will be a ""go-to"" piece in my closet!! the quality of the material and tailoring on the jacket is wonderful!!! as other reviewers have commented, it does run large. i am exchanging it for a size down. i can't wait to get it in and wear it!"

"You make classy stuff. this skirt is a nice take on a tweed skirt.
colors: can't tell from the picture, but there is red and pink thread as part of the tweed, very fun and happy, yet appropriate colors for fall and winter. the cut is very flattering, the scallop part is interesting though, it is sown at one part of the skirt, in the middle, not sure why. i ordered the 0p, and that fit me like a glove. (26.5 in waist, 35-36 in hips, 115 lbs).

length on the petite was above the knee, like show"
"This would be great on someone with a slim build. it's very true to size, it hits above the hips and runs pretty straight through the body for a boxy look. i loved the color and pointelle detail but on my thicker build it just sort of hung in a too-casual way. note that it is the kind of cotton that is likely to stretch with wear (and spring back with cleaning)."
This is a steal at the sale price. medium is large on me and i'm generally a large at retailer. so soft.
"I tried these on at the store and thought the color, texture and style was very nice, but i needed the petite length. so i came online but was disappointed to see that the style is sold out in petite! darn. the regular length hits me just above the ankle, so i suppose it is still do-able, but i hate to pay full price for something that doesn't fit quite right. maybe if it goes on sale i will consider it."
"Love the blue color. is a bit short, but fine with a tank underneath. i purchased the small, that's what i usually wear."
"This jacket is perfect! the crop length is just right! not to short and the way it is cut longer in the back it really paints a beautiful silhouette on my larger frame. i'm a a 12 typically but broad in the shoulders and larger in the bust 36dd. this jacket is loose fitting and roomy. i could probably have gone with a large, but i'm really happy with the xl as i can layer underneath and it's just super roomy and comfy. the quality of this jacket is great. it will be a staple for years to come. i"
"Tried on this maxi dress recently, hoping i would have a new dress to enjoy but the frabic is just too thin. so sad :(. unfortunately it shows every lump and bump and even wearing spanx while trying on it still showed too much. a full length slip would help but i decided to put it back."
"I love this top. i got a medium in black on sale. i am 5'8'' and 135lbs. the medium fits great. the medium is slightly loose on me through the tummy, which is nice - in my experience, it is not too constraining, contrary to other reviews. however, i think it depends on your body shape; i am a coke-bottle. this will be a wardrobe staple for day to day and going out; note, it is too low-cut for work wear. very happy with my purchase."
These are some of my favorite new pants. i am never disappointed by the quality from this brand and they are super comfortable and adorable. a definite must have!
"Gorgeous color and great price, but too low cut and because of the design, a cami's wouldn't work. disappointed"

"I'm surprised by the negative reviews and i'm here to come to its defense! i love this dress! i'm solidly a 0 petite in tracy reese and this fit perfectly. the top isn't snug but it's not roomy enough to say it runs large. just perfectly comfortable. the belt was a little tricky because it has to thread through several loops, but it stays put nicely and fit perfectly without being too snug or uncomfortable. the fitted top with the belt offsets the fit and flare style of the skirt. lace is beauti"
"I have been on the hunt for a replacement cargo jacket for about a year now. i thought this one was going to be it!! ordered it right away. i got it in an xl as retailer coats always seem to run small on me (i am very busty so sometimes the more fitted styles won't even close without a big gap). this is not the case with this jacket. it runs really big - it looks like it could be an xxxl...but the design is great with a zipper and button closures, pockets and cute back cut...the color is slightly"
"I bought this online. this looked like a sweater that was accidentally shrunk in the dryer, when i received it.

i will be returning this."
"Received december 23 and 83 degrees in louisiana but weather can change from hot to cold in an hour. this sweater is so soft, so cozy, i'm ready to run the air conditioning! beautiful styling, well-made, and has a generous fit that you may or may not prefer. this will be one of my very favorite garments . luxurious, and i deserve it. i ordered a large, have long arms, and the sleeves do come over hand as shown in photo. it is very loose and flows over my jeans. i am an extremely difficult to ple"
"Absolutely love, love this dress. it is so comfortable and falls perfectly. the material is great and you can dress it up or wear it casually. if it had more colors, i would get it it in any color it came in!!"
"This dress is very small in the bust and maxi length on short people (5'3"" 36dd). i can't wear a normal bra, i have to use adhesive pasties. the fabric is very smooth, thick and satin like, but fuzzes easily. mine came with minor thread pulls and one strap was sewn on twisted. the pattern in real life is very pink as opposed to the model sample which has more blue landscape. i'd like to hem the dress but i would sacrifice pattern. still very pretty dress. be sure to size up one or two depending"
"I bought this dress with my birthday gift and i do not regret it! it's so soft and feels like pure comfort but the details, little metal buttons down the front, the vent pleats on the side; make it feel special. i received many compliments and i would urge you to get this one if you are seeking comfort. it was pretty true to size and because i'm an average height i wore a small block heel with it."
"After reading the reviews about this top being really clingy, i decided to order up a size and purchased a medium. when i took it out of the box today and held it up it looked huge and i thought i had made a mistake. however when i tried it on it actually fit really well! i could see if i had ordered my usual small how it would have clinged to my body in a unflattering way. very happy with the top and thankful for the reviews."

"I'm 5'8, 130 and the small fit very nice. i ordered on line and on one of the legs the elastic closure at the bottom snapped. got a new pair at the store. you can dress these up or down. they are fun."
"Ive been on the hunt for big bulky sweaters because winter is coming and i live in the north, i saw this sweater and needed to give it a try. i got it i the mail and its truly gorgeous and extremely well made. this is the type of sweater to wear on a cold snowy day. it runs a little big but thats okay with me because its perfect to snuggle up in. i love this sweater but be aware it is thick and bulky so its not made to make you look like a twig. i like big sweaters and this design flows from sma"
"Great pair of pants to wear to work, and interview or out to lunch. i got so many compliments the first time i wore these. i'm 5'2"" i ordered the burgundy color in a size 0, regular which is what i normally wear and they fit fine. however they were just a tad big in the waist and a tad tight around my calves but other that they're a great pattern pant to have you wont be disappointed!"
"I ordered these pants in black and brick. the pattern is great, but the sizing and fit are way off. i usually wear an 8 or a medium in retailer. i ordered these pants in a 10, 12, and 12 petite. the 10 actually fit, but there is no stretch in these fitted pants. they were very uncomfortable to walk or sit in. however, if you're standing up all day and not doing much moving around, these pants are perfect! the print is great in both black and brick. i couldn't decide which one i liked best. wish th"
"This dress did not impress me when i was browsing the website online. when i went to a store, though, the colors struck me as really vibrant and earthy, and i wanted to give it a chance. i tried it on and it fit like a glow! i am a 5'1'', 100 pounds, and got an xxs p which was a perfect fit. the length was great for me (petite size) and did not need altering. the online photo may not do justice to the little details on this dress. definitely a very high quality dress that i would categorize as a"
Love this top. very easy to wear to lunch or site seeing. the fabric is soft and drapes nicely.
"I just received this in the mail and really enjoy it! it's a nice color and very gauzy/ airy. the only think i didn't love is that it's a little bit in the chest area, which is rare considering i'm usually a m in that area."
"I wanted this top ever since i saw it online, it is so me. it's a nice mix of feminine and masculine, you can pair it with a nice pair of jeans or even business pants to dress it up. this will make the perfect summer shirt and it hangs so nicely! i highly recommend this shirt, i would get it before its gone!"
"The fabric is very soft and the fit is formed to the body. low cut, so may want to pair with a cami. great basic for work!"
"I love sundry clothing. this lightweight fleece is the perfect weight. it keeps you warm enough when it's cold, but not hot when it is milder. it's super soft with nice embroidery. size 1 is a great fit for my 5'1"" frame. wear it to hang at home or to go out."
"This is a beautiful dress, considering it is made from polyester. that being said, the material has a nice finish and looks like it could be silk. it's a flattering cut (other than being a tad short-waisted) and hangs well. it was also a bit tight through the bust. unfortunately, if you are on the taller side, it tends to be high waisted and short in length.my daughter is 5'11"" and a size 10. the medium fit best, although because of the length, she is reluctantly returning it. sad, because it ha"
This sweater is great for cold weather. it is very comfortable and soft. only down side is it is a little boxy.
"I *loved* the brown color on the model, and i love the wrap style in general. however, i'm not sure if the color looks as goon on me. i first ordered my standard size small (5'7"", 137 lbs 32 b), which fit, but exchanged it for the looser fit (medium) shown in the pictures. i really like that the material is a thin, but not see through cotton. it has an extra cotton layer lining in front which is nice. the v isn't too low on me, so i don't *have* to wear a cami under. not really crazy about the s"
Love these pants. the design is totally different and that is what i love! i paired these with the velvet red shoes from this site - also on sale. for me these ran true to size.
"Someone returned my size so i got to try it on in store. the cut is very flattering, the material is stretchy. the lace part is nicely made too. overall great piece. the petite waist did hit me a little higher than on model, i have a regular torso and short legs (and overall usually need petite)"
"If you care that it's sheer- be forewarned. i probably won't wear a cami under it, as it's not terrible, but worth noting. that said, its lightweight fabric will be perfect for summer and its design is gorgeous boho at its best. it's cut quite generously and i do wish i'd gone down a size."
"I really love the look of this jumpsuit, casual but classy. shapely but comfortable. i'm 5'4 and, similar to another reviewer, proportional torso to leg ratio. the legs were longer on me than the model in the picture, but no problem there because they're cuffed.however the arm holes are too big. my bra shows, and the particular one i got came damaged with some of the embroidery coming unraveled on the back. it's also supposed to be dry cleaned and that's annoying for casual wear. returning it."
I sized up based on other reviews which was good advice. i am typically a size 6 but sized up to a 10. the pants are very unique and i think on the right body type would look amazing. it seems like someone with curves and a small waist might fit these splendidly...but that's not me. i had some extra material puffing about in the zipper region. i also expected the material to be thicker but found it to be more silky.
"I'm so glad the other reviewer also found these small. literally, the largest size i have ever bought. but the style is really cute, sort of dapper british boy..."
"Got these in the red brick color, and unfortunately had to send them back. these are really cute and i loved the color and pattern, but they ran very small, and the cut between the legs and hips was odd. this may not have been a problem had i gone up at least one size. best to try them on if possible."
"So comfortable, great fit, dress it up with wedges, down with flats,
extremely soft and flattering. i normally wear a xs/s and the small fit perfectly. i'm 5'6"" and the length is just slightly cropped."
"I just purchased these pants in red on sale. i am 5/5"", 143 pounds, and the 10 fit perfectly (i am either an 8 or a 10 in pants, depending upon brand). it is really hard for me to find pants that are cute, unique, work-appropriate, and flattering. these pants fit the bill in all aspects. i thought i would prefer the black, but am really glad i got the red."
"Great dress, fit perfectly warm for the winter, i live in florida it will be great if we get a winter next year. very comfortable and easy to wear."
"Tried this romper on in store and wanted to love it but it just didn't fit me right. it'a great romper, cute design, super soft-light fabric and overall a great feel but it doesn't work to well for short girls with any types of hips. i have a very small waist and larger bottom and this romper just was very unflattering. i couldn't get the tie waist to sit anywhere that felt like my natural waist, instead it kept giving me a kangaroo pouch and hung on my upper thighs. sizing up didn't help becaus"
"Being somewhat on the 'fluffy' side, the style is very flattering and forgiving and will be ideal for summer. i am between a size 14 and a 16 and the 14 fits perfectly. light and airy a very nice, simple embroidery in contrasting color. very chic in an effortless way. the armholes are just right--not too big! the color is definitely a creamy ivory. worth the cost because i don't think it will be available for too long."
I loved the jumpsuit but unfortunately had to return it due to running a little on the small size.
"I love these pants! beautiful quality material, soft on the skin. fits well. definitely a tailored fit. true to size. unique design, and really fun!
i am 5 foot 5, and weigh 132 lbs. i am apple shaped, so i was worried these would be too tight around the hips, but they aren't ."
I really liked this jumpsuit but it just wasn't perfect. the design at the top is a bit stiff compared to the rest of the jumpsuit. i felt the whole thing ran just slightly too large. it was nice - but not amazing.

"I love this romper!  i am 5'2 and the medium fit great and wasn't long.  i'm short so i thought i would have to hem this!  it's comfortable and, although, i'm not a huge fan of gauze, the fit was perfect.  i had to
snatch it!"
"I&#39;ve been looking for comfortable pants that i could wear to work and at home.  these fit the bill.  i bought these in the holly color for the fall and winter.  they are super soft and very comfortable.  i was worried that they would like dumpy, especially around the seat area, but they fit fine."
"However, i unfortunately followed others advice saying these run small. i had to return/ exchange to a 00p. in turn had to give up the sassy red and settle for black. although they are beautiful trousers in black as well..."
"Received this shirt yesterday and loved it. doesn't look that great online in pics, but it is a unique and beautiful top. the material is a substantial woven cotton so it lays nicely and keeps its shape . i am 5'5 and 128lbs and a small bust size 34a , i usually wear small in shirts but since it is a longer length i didn't want it to tight around my butt.... i am curvy in that area size 6 pants....i ordered the medium and i am so glad i did .. it lifts just like on the model...the only downfall"
"Unique print but not great execution. the pant legs are very tight, i have average sized calves and i sized up one size. the hook closure was oddly tight and difficult to clasp. when i first saw the color it looked like burnt sienna or a dried blood color. too bad this didn't work out."
"This dress is absolutely amazing! i am an retailer addict, a good portion of my wardrobe is from retailer. that being said, this is one of my all time favorite purchases! this dress is a beautiful statement. i am tall and curvy and this dress fits like a glove but is very comfortable. the quality of the beading and the fabric is very good. i wore it on my hawaii vacation, and got numerous compliments! don't pass this one up! five stars!"
"I wanted to love this sweater. the photo of the model makes it look so soft and warm. i liked the heavy texture and the extra long sleeves. however, after receiving this sweater i tried it on for less than 1 minute. one look in the mirror was enough to make me take it off and return it asap. the knit quickly expanding from small to large right over the bust, combined with the boxy shape was an atrocious combo. it must have added 30lbs to my physique and made my bust look matronly. yikes! this ma"
"This dress is comfortable and versatile - one could wear it to the office or to a social event, day to night. i didn't find the sizing to run as large as some of the other reviewers did. i felt it was true to size. it is not lined so you would need a slip under it if you wear it with tights or nylons, otherwise the skirt will cling."
"Such a beautiful print. i sized up to a 14 because it looked like it has a high waist and it does. the waist comes almost to my bra line. unfortunately, there's a huge amount of fabric and it swallowed me. not slimming at all. i felt like i was wearing a curtain.  i loved the slits in the photo but due to the amount of fabric they weren't visible. i'm short and this literally pooled on the ground a few inches. if you're tall and thin, this is a beauty."
"I am usually a size 2 in tops. i am very, very rarely a size 0, so upon reading other reviews of this top i decided to order the 2 and assumed it would fit the way a 2 usually does. obviously this is designed to be a loose, flowing top. that's why i wanted to order it. however, the 2 is simply too loose in every direction. my primary gripe is that the arm holes are gaping and falling at the side in a way i don't think it intended.

i do really like the styling and quality, so i am planning on"
"These pants are fantastic! the pattern alone is to die for, but they also have just the right amount of stretch for the perfect fit! i received so many compliments when i wore them i felt like a rock star!"
"Bought these in 2p and i'm normally 0p in most pants. for reference, i'm 5'1 and 107 lbs and the 2 fit perfect! got many compliments on these pants"
"Unlike other reviewers, i found these pants to run true to size (in my case, my usual 6) or even a tad roomy. the red pattern is just festive enough for informal holiday parties. i appreciate the belt loops!"
"Decent quality. i am 5'4"" 130 pounds. m is too big. runs slightly large."
"Very comfy and flattering. cool on a hot day. slightly difficult to use the restroom, though."
"These pants are so fun. i love the pattern and color. can be dressed up or down. very flattering.
highly recommend trying them on, they were better than i expected them to be"
"I bought these on a whim, patterned bottoms aren't normally my thing. i was pleasantly surprised. they fit well, look great and i had lots of compliments."
This jumpsuit is great. i recently had a baby and am still trying to get the last 10 lbs of baby weight off and this jumpsuit is very forgiving and super comfortable. i'm usually a medium & i wasn't sure if i should size up. i ordered the medium and it was the right choice. great light material for summer and nice neckline.
I bought this today in a size 2. fits perfect. i am normally a 0 or 2 or xs. the top looks and fits exactly like the picture if you are small chested. because it is not long in the front. i think if you are larger chested the top will stick out too much and be too short in front. it is not super voluminous in front which is a good thing. it does have the volume in the back which gives it a cute shape. it is on the shorter side. very nice material and design as well as details. overall good pick.
This dress is absolutely beautiful! it fits like a glove and the material is super soft. so in love with this! i'm 5'2'm and normally a xs/s. the xspwas a better fit in the waist and chest. the arm holes were a bit tighter on me. the sp was way too large.
"Beautiful patterns and colors, but it sits very high and runs small. i'm normally a size 4 and got the small. zipped all the way, but on the snug side. the skirt sits so high that the fabric coming down was a bit awkward. such a shame because it really is beautiful and looks great on the model probably because she's wearing a belt to hide how high it rides and flares out."
"I tried on this dress in the store and absolutely fell in love! i'm a bigger gal who is busty and have wider hips. this dress made me look and feel slimmer, and is light to wear. the dress is a perfect length too. i'm 5'11 and this dress hits me right at the ankles. if your looking for a long dress to wear that can be either formal or casual, this one is perfect!"
"I decided to try this on just for fun because the colors and design are absolutely gorgeous. here are my thoughts:
_________________
pros:
- the jeweled neckline is lovely! it really helps set the dress apart.
- pockets!!! such an elegant dress to have pockets is a huge plus in my book. :)
- the length is ideal for taller folk.
- it swings beautifully on the body and flares out quite a bit on the bottom. if you're tall as i am, this won't be an issue.
- nicely conservative at the top.

cons:
- i"
I loved this sweater when i saw it online and ordered right away. i purchased a s and the fit was very off. the arms were long (which i don't mind) but the sweater was also super heavy and bulky so it was not at all flattering. i really wanted to love it and it seemed to be of good quality but it i had to return it.
Love sundry. great quality. if you want a looser more comfy fit size up!
Beautiful colors
"This just wouldn't lay right on me. the top is really too big. maybe if you're really busty, this is great, but not for me. i know the top is supposed to be a bit blousy, but it was huge and droopy and unflattering (not like in the picture). the arm holes were too big and hung down so you could see my bra, which i really hate and which is way too common lately. the bottom half fit perfectly, so sizing up or down would not have helped. the material is super light and comfy, which i liked very muc"
This is one of my favorite tops i've ordered. flowing and relaxed with great details at the neck. i get compliments every time i wear it.
"This jumpsuit is lovely and comfortable, with gorgeous embroidered detailing, but it really needs to come in petite sizes. at 5'4"" with a pretty proportional torso to leg ratio, i found the hem length okay but the top portion way too long. for the waistband to be anywhere near my natural waist, the shoulders would have had to be taken up several inches and the armholes shortened."
"This dress is stunning! my sister-in-law was hoping to use it as a bridesmaid dress for her wedding and i ordered it for fitting purposes. it fit beautifully on my 5'10"" frame. unfortunately she decided against it due to availability and because of the length on the shorter bridesmaids. while it fell to a couple inches above my ankles, it made the shorter girls look shorter. i ended up returning it but am regretting not keeping it now!"
"I was a little concerned ordering these online without seeing them in person but they do not disappoint! the fabric has a little texture to it that makes them look and feel like a high quality pant. the design is unique and provides visual appeal, and i still feel like i can wear them in my office without looking out of place. i love the high waist on these!"

"This skirt is a nice medium weight and is lined. my normal size 4 fit perfect. i only wish it was available in petites. if you are petite, the skirt is ankle length. but this is a good skirt to wear to work."
"Runs large and pocket detail is very prominent. wanted a crisper, trouser-like pant--this is not it!"
"The beadwork is gorgeous, but the sleeves are so puffy, it looks as though you're wearing shoulder pads. the fabric of the shirt isn't that fabulous either."
These trousers are wonderful. the fabric is comfortable and does have a little give to it.
"I really wanted to not like the top for that price, but ti looks really good, the beading makes the shirt stunning... i ordered the 0p, not sure what size to get, and it is just fine. the length is almost too short, but isn't. the rest of the shirt fits nicely. the shoulder are wide, like poofing out a bit, perhaps that is hwy some people thought it looked large? the beading work is beautiful also a little sheer, but not crazy. debating whether to keep it but right now i love it. also, teh colla"
"Very pretty top, comfortable and soft but looks nice enough for work!"
Normally i am a size 10 or 12 but i sized down to a small. still very swingy and beautiful. i bought the pink and the taupe as well. the colors are beautiful and have great texture to hide stains!
"I was a little surprised when i received this dress, as it is little more than an a-line tube with elastic casing at the top and a cute knotted detail at the bust. i guess i expected the bust to be lined at least. it is unlined, and a relatively thin jersey knit. it wasn't see through, for it is black, but i expected a heavier fabric. i would never have paid full price for this, but at the sale price it is very cute and comfortable. it is also flattering and the fit is true to size. the a-line t"
"This shirt is so great. it's beautiful and functional. i received countless compliments the first time i wore it. i'm looking forward to wearing it again! worth the steep price, though it was hard to justify."
"Very pretty blouse. it does run quite large, i am usually an xs-s or 0-4 and purchased the 0. i could probably have gone to a 00. for reference i am 5'4"" 118 lbs 34b/c. it says that it is dry clean only, however i washed in in delicate cycle with cold water and threw in the dryer for a little bit. it came out perfect! i was hoping to shrink it and it only shrunk a tiny bit. i was hoping for it to shrink more but it is fine. no need to even iron it! i was lucky enough to get it on sale, i don't t"
The blue was a great color and i like the idea of a reversible top. however the xs was just swimming on me. this looks much more fitted in the pictures. my favorite workout top is from this brand and it is fitted and held up for 6 months. where are the fitted tops?? i'll keep looking.
This runs really big. i usually wear s or m so i got a small but i need the xs in this top and it is sold out. i don't have a store close by (about an hour away) and i hate paying shipping for returns! i will either have to plan a trip to the store or try to exchange for size over the phone. i debated keeping the small but it is really too big .... i love the style though!
I am always looking for a nice denim skirt and this one is great the pale pink is perfect and the stretch is awesome. i wore wedges with it and a nice romantic top and it looked great. i originally got a 8 and a 10 and kept the 8 because of the stretch it fit perfectly. nice length and great quality
"I purchased this top in the taupe color, and it is much prettier in person than it photographs online. it runs about a half size too large, and sits slightly off the shoulders. fun casual top for the fall."
This is not worth $128. it looks cute on but....there is no support in the bust area. just a slight tuck in the fabric -it also is very flowy which is great and it is comfortable but for the price and the thinness and lack of meatiness to the fabric itself i cannot recommend and will be returning. i'll look for something else. i haven't bought from retailer in a dogs age and i hope the quality hasn't slipped - i will look for another option.
"I got this top in an xs and the fit is great. the top is a little darker than pictured. it looks great with white, kaki and denim."

This is a beautiful beaded shirt. the quality seems good. i just didn't like the shoulders. they are pleated and puffy. the picture doesn't really show them very well. also the collar is a little floppy. i was hoping it would have an option to stand up but that is not the case. the beading is well done and looks to be stable. i just thought it ran a little large and the shoulders looked puffy. i returned it.
"I was pleasantly surprised with the fit of this top! at 5' 6"", i'm rather busty, short waisted, and full-figured. i ordered my usual size 16, and the fit is a flattering, 'almost' empire silhouette. i was worried about the back being too long for my body shape, but it works great. the embroidery and construction make this a really special piece."
"I've been adoring this online and while in store i happened upon this blouse and tried it on. the material was sturdy and the beading oh-so lovely, but on my frame it looked terrible. (i normally wear size m/10 in retailer clothes). as another reviewer mentioned, this blouse has rather puffy sleeves which aren't evident in the photo of the model. as well, i also didn't love the collar, which doesn't quite lay flat. if i were to buy this i would have to wait for it to go on sale and then get the po"
"This skirt is a rare find. slimming, flowing, and best of all, it finally sits on my waist and not on my hips, while hugging the hips in all the right places for the streamlined and sexy look. the fabric is substantial, yet soft, so no weird sticking out sides. the color is delicious very pale-tea-rose, better in person that the picture here, and is fresh for summer. nice length for office. easy to pair with either fitting or loose top/s and jackets. i also got a distressed denim pilcro west to"
"Extremely disappointed with this top. it runs extremely large. i'm 5'2, 130 lbs, 34c and usually wear between a 0-2 & xs-s tops at retailer. i ordered a 0 and it looked like a maternity top on me. the bottom half of the top flared out and did not fit close to the body at all. fabric was also a gauze-like material that was not soft. unfortunately, i will be returning."
"Tried this lovely with high waste, wide leg, black flowy pants. everything i could hope for and more, but not quite!

size: blindly ordered size 6. i'm usually a small, occasionally xs in retailer brands like floreat and akemi+kin. i'm 5'5"" tall, 130 lbs, 34d, 35-29-37, long torso, narrow shoulders, and short arms.

fit: size 6 had just enough space through the bust. the lace edged sleeves were roomy and just reached my wrists. the shoulders were just right. extra fabric ballooned out around t"
"Fabric is soft, body runs a bit big but falls nicely. length is great for leggings or skinny jeans. overall, wonderful tee shirt!"
"The skirt is a little longer than i expected, it hits me at my calf, i considered having it shorten knee length but believe that may takeaway some of the aesthetic so i'm going to wear it as it. the quality is quite nice and the color is lovely, very feminine. nice skirt for a picnic"
I tried these on in the store and didn't buy them with the other items in my 'yes' pile. i couldn't stop thinking about them and ended up ordering them. they are so cute. the fabric is a nice weight. they have little stretch.
"I was glad that i was able to get this shirt which is really more of a spring/summer item, but i found it wide in the body and the shoulders."
"It's hard to go wrong with the charlie's, especially in this fabric, keep them coming!! i wrote a review on the brush strokes as well. they fit pretty true to size, i'd say try both your usual size and one size down as well, they stretch out a little, so if they feel a little tight keep that in mind. because of the texture of these pants you can wear so many more colors than just usual black and white trouser fabric. try wearing a burnt orange, green, or pink (the isabella sinclair grid wrap but"
Can't go wrong with these new charlie's by cartonnier. they fit amazingly. the fabric is a textured cotton but doesn't seem to wrinkle. just shook them out of the bag yesterday. the fabric description says cotton and spandex so they have some give (just a little) but are not going to stretch out after wearing for an hour. paired it with all sorts of different tops. side zip is slimming. lined pockets. substantial fabric. nothing bad to say. if you haven't tried a pair of charlies you should. you
"Ordered the pink in a small, but it ran big...the xs was perfect for my 5'6' medium frame. it is comfortable and the fabric has an interesting texture. looks great with chinos or jeans. might need to get the other color."
"When i first pulled this shirt from the box i thought it was a for sure winner. the beading was stunning, it was just so elegant and the details are perfection. ""till i tried it on and had some reservations. the sleeves (at the top) were very poofy and just would not lay in a flattering way unless they were rolled above my elbow to tighten them. and as a taller gal, i wish it were a tad longer (in the model shot, looks a bit short from the back view). i fear tucking it would loosen the bead work"
"This is a really great top. it looks fantastic on. while it is a bigger fit, its so flattering. i get tons of compliments every time i wear it."
"I ordered this shirt last week, it's beautiful!!!!! it's even prettier than the photo. i'm 5.3 120lbs ,i ordered the petite 6 and it fit perfectly!!!! i wish it came in more colors, i'd order another one in a minute!"
"So i actually loved this skirt (the tea rose color and coppery gold buttons were perfect together) and it's rare to find something that's simultaneously so form-fitting and comfortable.... but i hold a lot of my weight in my butt and thighs, and i just felt like it was a little too sexy for work (especially with that long slit - i might feel differently if it didn't have that slit, because then i could at least pair it with a cute oversized cardigan to tone things down a bit for the office). if"
"Very cute top but runs very very big ! im5 ft 5 in tall, 120 lbs. i ordered the xs but it was so big it looked like a maternity top.. sadly returned the top. otherwise the top was made of good quality fabric."
I love this vest. get compliments every time i wear it. it's stretchy too :). unfortunately i got ranch dressing on it and spot treated it with shout and now the spot is gone but the color faded there. so little tip don't spill on it lol. my fault though so still 5 stars!
"I have been eyeing this piece for months now! i broke down and bought it when they finally had my size in stock. i am 5 '4 and 110 lbs and have a very small chest so i ordered an xs. i think the top is too baggy for me. yes, the top and bottoms fit overall, but it doesn't look as nice and form fitting like it does on the model. it is very sheer--which is the thing that discourages me the most. i love the concept of this piece but the execution could use some work, which i am willing to work on s"
"This top is everything i wanted it to be. the fabric is beautiful, and the fit is flowy and comfortable. i would love to own a u-neckline version."
"Great t. great lightweight, almost linen like fabric. a bit on the sheer side, but love the fit and the neckline!"
I bought this for my mother and she really loves it. it is a bit on the large side for her but have decided to keep it. the quality seems very good and great styling for a washable item! i actually like it so much i may order one for myself!
"I order this sweater in black - size small - and i just love it. i'm a slender 5' 9"" 130 lbs and the small is perfect in for me. while it has the classic cardigan look and a slightly oversized ""boyfriend"" feel to it, the rounded front hem, hip pockets, and buttons that end slightly above the bottom hem (where the rounded hem begins) are unique touches i appreciate and love in retailer's clothing. the weight was slightly heavier than i expected and better quality, but it is perfect for my minneapol"
"Flattering fit and neckline. too thin to wear without a cami or tank underneath (for me), but i was expecting that. great go-to tee."
"I've been looking at these for some time and i finally pulled the trigger. i'm glad i did because these tights are such a fun accessory to add to my wardrobe. they add just enough whimsy to classic dresses and skirts. these are not your everyday thin stretchy tights. they remind me of the tights i would wear in the winter as a little girl; they are really sweater tights. i think this aspect is great, but they do not have as much give as other tights. i am petite, about 5'3"" 112 lbs and the small"
"I expected the waist to be cinched like it appears on the model but it isn't. i ordered the xs and i'm swimming in it (i'm 5'4"" and 120 lb). would suggest ordering a few sizes down to avoid looking like you're wrapped in grandma's table runner."
"I love this top. i am always looking for tops that are comfortable and work as basics. the material is super soft and not too clingy. it feels like pajamas, but looks very polished. i am a little wide in the stomach and bust, but this didn't look boxy. i got these in all 3 colors."
"This was what i was looking for ! the little stripes ,black and white color,the shape of the jacket and skirt together....well perfect. kind of. i purchased this entire ensemble. the skirt was going to be shortened because well i'm short. no problem ,this is a common occurrence for me. but the jacket would not work for me. the sleeves were way too tight for my muscular arms. there was no way the adorable shirt would fit in there. the shirt is adorable by the way. all of these pieces are made ver"
"This top is just as beautiful in person as online. however, it has two issues for me. 1. it is too short. this might work if you have a short torso, but it would forever show my stomach. 2. the fabric has way too much static cling. no matter what i tried, it just clung to my stomach and flared out at the sides. not attractive. in short, if you have a short torso and don't mind battling the static, this truly is a beautiful top."
"These tights are so cute and can add some fun to any outfit. i paired with a mustard mini, denim shirt and desert boots! they do run small. i am a size 4 and had to get the m/l"
"I love retailer sweaters, in fact, i believe all my sweaters are from retailer! this cardigan is really nice and i'm so glad i bought it. it will work well with skirts, dresses, pants... it's well made and soft and comfy. highly recommended!"
"I really wanted to love this shirt. the fit was great, and the fabric just felt beautiful. luxurious, soft and flowing. but the collar was frayed... in addition, the little keyhole area fabric also had to be carefully handled to make it look smooth and not like bad workmanship. i put it aside to return it, then this morning went to have another look at it, wanting to talk myself back into it. but i can't overlook the fact i'd be ordering a new shirt that would look time-worn. it may be only this"
"This cardi is cuter in the stock photos. in person, the colors are a bit more drab. stock photos also don't show quite how much of a swing shape this has. it is very soft, though. returned it!"
The material is cheap and looks torn. not as nice as the picture.
"Order a size down. i ordered a small from catalog and returned it to the store for an xs.
run large in the chest and down. the fit is more flowing than form fitting. nice material, not itchy at all."
"This is a really nice top, especially for the price. i am 5'6"", 34dd, 140 lbs and normally wear a medium in dolan tops. in this top i purchased size small since the gathered front provides ample room for my bust. some reviewers have found this top to be on the ""boxy"" side. i can see that if you don't size down as i did. i found the medium to have too much fabric and look very baggy whereas the small was perfect. i do wish this top was a tad bit longer and less sheer, though. white tops should be"
"This cardigan runs slightly large as it is boxy, which i love. the color is exactly as pictured and it is soooo soft! can't wait to wear it with a t-shirt and jeans!"
"I bought this shirt in the rust color along with the blue/black sweater skirt after seeing it on display in the store. not sure i would have ever put those 2 together but i love the outfit. i'm not much of a shirt-tucker, either, but this shirt works either way. tucked in a skirt or more casual with jeans. my only criticism is the static cling in the front, as mentioned by another reviewer. i had thought of getting it in white, but if it's shear, then maybe not. haven't been wearing a tank under"
"The bright poppy red is gorgeous and the cut flattering and interesting. i'm usually between a m and l in tops but went with a s in this one because it looked too sloppy in my usual size. i'm a 32-34 d with arms that aren't tiny, and it's a bit tight across the shoulders when i reach forward but not enough to be a problem. in the smaller size it skims my hips nicely but isn't as long as pictured on the model. i would suggest pear-shaped girls size down if in-between. it is sheer but not so much"
"Adorable foxes, i was smitten in the store but the fix is bizarre and the foxes don't come up very high so you're limited in the length you can wear. i bought the m/l based on salesperson advice and i can't imagine trying anything smaller, i usually wear a size s or 4 bottom, these were super snug. back to the store they went."
"I tried this top because i loved the not so simple, simpleness of it. however, it was a miss for me. loved the fit and style, which i'd say is pretty true to size, i just didn't love the color on me. i went for the orange one and the color was a bit too bright for my liking. cute top though! for reference i'm a usually small, i'm 5'4"" and a small fit perfectly."

"Ordered the ""white"" tee, but when it arrived today, i was surprised by how cream it looked.the cut is nice and as other reviewers mentioned, it is on the sheer side. still on the fence of whether or not i'll keep it."
"I am short, on the heavy side. 5'1"" 156 lbs. i always wear large petite. this beautiful blouse swallows me. lots of fabric on the front side of the shirt, causing a boxy look. i could totally do a mp if not sp. i am going to try and exchange..
beautiful blouse, great quality, breathable fabric. colors are deep and rich. so comfy.. highly recommend."
Good structure and quality; a bit large and wish i had ordered something a bit brighter! (i ordered the white tee.)
"Adore the rust color in this top. very pretty rust color. would go with a lot of stuff. my only small pet peeve with the shirt is the opening under the hook and eye. i have been wearing a seamless tank underneath. but everything else about the blouse fits so perfect, drapes nicely that i think the opening is a minor thing that a tank top can fix. beautiful on. felt that it fit tts. i'm usually a 34b, got an xs in this top."
"This sweater is thicker and darker than it appears online. i thought it would be more of a blush color, but it's more dark gray and brown. it wasn't that flattering on me as a cardigan. looked a little cuter all buttoned up, but ultimately i am not keeping because of the color."
"I like to have a capsule wardrobe for all seasons so that when i travel, or just for everyday, i have a multitude of options with a few good quality pieces. i am not a fan of 'dry clean only' items, so anything that i can find that i can at least hand wash with good results and is within my color palette and sense of style is always a great find. this light weight cardi can work for multiple seasons easily, it is a tad boxy, but it actually works for me (5'4, 34c, 125 lbs) i can wear it with a c"
"This sweater is far more slouchy and relaxed in fit than in it seems in the photograph. definitely size down. honestly, i kinda love it anyways! the inside is so very soft, and it's perfect for a sleek errand-running or hiking kind of day!"
"This is a cute work jacket, as well as paired with jeans.  flattering. very soft.  only con is this is thick with a soft cotton lining, so not great for summer in az, but will get plenty of use this fall. typically 6-8 on the top, i went with medium.  not tight in the arms as other reviewer noted."
"I have this top in orange and white. it is a great top to throw on with jeans. don't put it in the dryer, will shrink."
"This vest is perfect. it is a great layering piece to be worn with jeans, slacks or a skirt. it has a substantial weight without being restrictive. i made the purchase based on the other positive reviews and it was ""love at first sight."""
"The material is more like a great tee for the sleeves and the back, so it is so comfortable. i agree with the previous review, i am not thrilled about the hook and eye, but it still looks cute with a tank under it. i bought it in black and i am ordering it as well in white. it looks great with skinny jeans or pants."
Such cute tights! i saw them and had to have them. they are a thick knit - very good quality. the color is a dark navy and the little foxes and a nice pop of color. i get lots of compliments on them.
"This is a very cute, casual sweater. i originally ordered a size medium but i had to send it back because it was way too large all over. i recently received the size small and i'm going to keep it. it is still a roomy fit but the overall design of the sweater is a relaxed fit. the color combination and texture of this sweater is lovely."

I love layering this over basic tees (or graphic ones like the wild west tee) - it adds just the right amount of edge. currently building my pin collection to add on (vintage turquoise and rock music to be exact).
"Classic and stylish. trendy with the blocking...rich colors, soft and comfy. i typically wear s and s was perfect. i love this sweater."

"These tights are so cute, but the sizing leaves much to be desired. i guess they are true to size since they are labeled s/m.

i'm 5'0"" with shorter legs than torso, and i suppose i'm lucky that i have muscular (read: large) quads/thighs to suck up some of the fabric, otherwise these might have just bunched up at my ankles.

the other thing i don't love about them is the feel of the fabric - it's more sweater-like (and not a soft sweater) than stretchy. maybe that was the intent, but i find tigh"
"Nice fabric, great color, would be lovely ... on someone with a straight-and-narrow body type. for ladies with curves, take a pass--too much like maternity wear, and not in that elegantly slouchy kind of way. the straight-up ""is she or isn't she"" kind of way."
"This bra is just as cute in person as it is in the pic! i can tell it's pretty well made and i love that it has a lot of little details like on the straps and the cute front-closure and lacy racerback. it also fits pretty true to size, which is a must for me because i often get bras that leave my boobs spilling out. however, this bra isn't the comfiest even though it looks like it would be pretty comfy in the picture.the style doesn't look too stiff or anything and the size i got isn't too tight"
I love this top!!! i just had a baby and it is difficult to balance classy with comfortable with out looking sloppy. this top is perfect. it may run a tiny bit big but for the most part it is true to size. great for busty girls (36dd).
"The color of this top is a bit more vibrant than online. material is light, but i can wear a beige bra underneath and not need a cami. fit was true to size for me and detail at the neckline is flattering. a keeper for me!"
I had to have this when i saw it in a store. i was drawn to the shape and the neutral colors. i wore it for the first time today with a black tank. on me it looks best unbuttoned. it looks good with pants. the small fit best although the arms are a little tight at the upper arms. i have muscles so i don't think i could wear it with any top with sleeves.
"The color is as pictured, like a deep coral. very comfy and great drape."
These fox tights are so very cute and fun! how can you not smile when wearing these tights designed with the cutest foxes all over! they are warm too! these go great under dresses or tunics and i always get compliments when wearing them! they are a real attention getter!
"I really like this vest. personally, i think it is difficult to find vests that fit properly. this is a good one. fabric and color good. the photo is very representative of the color. no surprises there. arm holes are not too big which is often a problem. the detail on the back gives it some added interest. the only thing i would mention that could be a negative is that it is short, especially in the back. again the picture is representative but do pay attention to the length and be certain that"
"I didn't pay much attn to this online. i'm not much on front hook & tie closures. well, saw today at the local store & decided to try on both the s & m. i am usually a s in tops, but the m was only a bit more roomy & longer than the s, so i went with the size m. i thought the styling of it paired well w/ the pilcro cord skinnys i had on. looked much better than the pics online. i have other pilcro skinny cords & jeans in vs colors so i think this top will work out well for me. love the 3/4 sleev"
"I'm glad this was on sale because i would not have purchased it at full price due to the strange fit in the sleeve. the shirt has a slight raglan sleeve, but the sleeves do not fit loosely, they kind of twist under the armpit area. i do not have large arms, so i am ok with straightening out the knit sleeves, but they do not fit right. i also was surprised at the unfinished edge along the neckline. it is messy and tacky looking, but i think that is how it was meant to be. my recommendation to buy"
"Note to photographers: please don't cinch the wait of a blouse to make something look tailored when it isn't. this could have been a real win if it had been more simply executed. i'm petite, way too much fabric. returned."
"Fell in love with this a soon as i saw it in store. it is soft and can eaisly be dressed up or down. wore it to work already and got so many compliments. 
unfortunately when i saw it in store they didn't have it in stock. the very helpful gentlemen at the irvine, ca location checked online but it was sold out in my size. so he checked the stores that carried it. i called one and the mailed it to me. customer service in store is great!"
"Lovely embroidery with a classic look, great addition to your wardrobe."
"At first, i thought this top was going to be stiff. i am pleasantly surprised by how soft and flowy this blouse is. it's lovely cream color with beautiful lace details. i appreciate the lining inside the bodice which means i can potentially go bra-less when it's hot! i'm 5'2'', 135lb and retailer size s usually gives me plenty of room because i have a small upper body. but i feel this top is slight short on me. that might be because i didn't wear it off-the-shoulder but had it hang from the top of"
"I honestly never even tried this on - i ordered it and when it arrived it was not the kelly green color pictured, it was more of a dark bland green color. love the brand and very soft but had to return."
"Perfect jean. these jeans are comfortable, the length is great, and the rise, at least for me, is spot on. my torso is fairly straight - not a lot of the hourglass thing going on - and somehow these jeans feel like they were made for me. thank you pilcro."
This is going to be my go to all season. looks great with a sweater dress and boots also looks great with cords!
"This skirt was horrible on me. it was loose in the waist, tight in the hips and poofed out like crazy at the tiered part on the bottom. the material also felt cheap and clingy. i guess the fit is tts, but it's hard to tell given how strange the cut was."
"I love this and instantly felt sexier when i put it on, yet with the longer sleeves and looseness felt i could wear it casually. 

i will say that i have to often keep adjusting/pulling the top neckline down. it seems to want to revert to above-the-shoulders position. 

the fabric and quality feels nice and it was a great purchase for me!"
"I just received my duster . i love it! the coat is as pictured. the fabric is medium weight denim with some stretch. it feels like a denim coat that you have worn for years. i'm 5'8"" and the duster hits mid-calf. i'm a curvy size 14-16 and the xl fits perfectly. the only issue that might arise is that the sleeves are long; they fit me perfectly but i have long arms. this will be my new go to coat for fall."
"The design is graceful and both my kids said it was a keeper ""pretty,"" even the boy child.

somehow i feel it makes my tummy look bigger than it is, maybe with the belt on my jeans."
"These jeans are an even dark color that can be dressed up. the material is soft and they fit perfect. they are mid rise which is a little different for me as i mostly where low rise. the only problem is that they are really long. i am 5'9"" and they are too long for me which never happens. so i need to get them hemmed and wont be wearing them for a few more weeks. i look forward to rocking them with a pair of booties or heels."
"The problem with off the shoulder tops is that the neckline is totally elastisized , therefore upon any movement of your arms the top pops above your shoulders making it go from stylish to matronly . the only elastic should be right at the shoulders , the rest of the neckline should be a simple finished hem. ."
A cute top. slightly tight in the upper area. debated returning but decided to keep as the top is unique and i know that i will wear it frequently. aleardy thinking of way to wear all year around! runs small
"Unlike the other reviews, i love this skirt. the lining is a nice stretchy material, as is the eyelet overlay, making it a really easy to wear, and comfortable skirt while still looking polished and professional.   
i bought it so that its slim fitting, more like a pencil skirt. 
i've only worn it to work dressed up, with boots, but suspect i'll get a lot of use in the summer with flip flops and a tee shirt. 
i highly recommend it, and think it's a great price. 
it is longer than on the mode"
"I love panties. i love the prettiest, softest, most adore-worthy panties i can find. these are my favorite boy shorts--i can always put them on and feel pretty. no weird tight spots and the lace has a perfect amount of stretch. im a mom and my body isn't perfect anymore, but these panties give me confidence, with perfect coverage. i choose them more often than any other in my lingerie drawer. my only warning: wash these pretties as delicates, or the lovely lace colors will fade."
"I can't figure out if this skirt is supposed to be high-waisted (if so, it's too big but the length works), or if it's supposed to sit on my hips (fits well but too long). but the material is really comfortable, and the design is different in a good way."
I'm glad i got this skirt because it's prettier in person than in the picture. fiance loves it so that's a bonus. it's tts although it's longer than shown on the picture. very high quality and looks expensive. i'm very happy with this purchase.
"This is a very nice dress. the jersey is soft and high quality. the construction appears solid. the color is very pretty, and looks in real life just like it does on my computer. the cut and draping just don't work for me. there's just too much draping, too much fabric. it overwhelmed me and made me look bigger than i am. i have a feeling this would be much more flattering on a curvier figure than my own. this dress seemed to be trying to accentuate curves i don't really have (especially in the"
"I tried this on in-store and would have purchased if it have been a better price, it wasn't something i could justify spending $100 bucks on. it's cute and was surprisingly comfortable but again, not worth the asking price. i will buy when it goes on sale."
"I was out of town when my coat arrived, and was so excited to get home and try it on!!  i haven't worn it yet, but we've now got the weather for it...and i can't wait!  i'm 5'7"" and heavier than i'd like, but the xl fit perfectly!"
"Retailer sizes are all over the place. i fell in love with this top, and tried it a couple of times to see if it would work. unfortunately i have to send it back. the design and colors are very good. the side slits are very high, right up to the waist, but the top still looks good. unfortunately it is very small. it still fits because of the long side slits, and is not that tight at the top due to sleeveless, but the fit just wasn't as flattering. it does seem to run 1-2 sizes small, so i a"
Fits beautifully. perfect for spring and summer. the cut of this skirt gives your figure a wonderful shape. the quality of the material is excellent.  this item is perfect for to dress up for a date night or wear slightly more casually for a brunch.
"I ordered this in my usual size 0 and couldn't finish zipping up the top, but also couldn't fill in the boobs. i am 5'7, 116 lbs, 32a. it is very cute, but the top was pretty stiff and unless it draped on you correctly, could probably be bothersome. i was disappointed in the quality of the skirt- no lining, simple cotton/polyester. i will probably return, try the size up, but was disappointed compared to how excited i was for it. i did like that it had pockets, and would be a fun dress to wear f"
"I love this dress so much. the fabric on top is not something i would have chosen-it is thick and almost an elastic kind of feel. but i have grown to appreciate that since this dress is not amenable to most bras. i think the fabric would be thick enough on top to actually just do without one. otherwise you would have to go with a strapless-and the right kind of strapless, with this dress.

when they say it flares it really does-and much more than i was expecting. the bottom part of the skirt f"
"Timeless skirt. just don't like the placement of the slit, so maybe i'll sew it up."
"I was so excited about this skirt and pairing it with a cute blouse for the warmer weather. as i took out the skirt out of the package and flipped it around, the back has mesh strips that are see through! there is also no lining to go with this skirt. if you go back to the ""back view"" picture on the website and zoom in closely, you can see the model's black underwear."
Nice color and cut but runs very big so size down. will need to send back due to on line only. i am hoping one size smaller does the trick.
"I love the style of this dress, but unfortunately, it runs very small. i normally wear a size 8. i ordered a 10 and the dress was closer to a size 6. disappointed that i had to return it. also, the seams were poorly done and threads hung out everywhere on the hem."
"This dress did not work for me. i tried it in my bigger size 6 since i am coming off winter weight gain. the dress fit tts but was squishing the breasts like tight bandages. i have smaller chest and the stretch bodycon fabric of the bodice made me look flat-chested. the straps did not sit flat on shoulders, i assume because they were not pulled tight enough by the chest. the dress was uncomfortable and felt strange on. but i can see how others with more curves on top will love the support of the"
"When i first tried this top on, i didn't like it because the chest just spilled open. i saw it on someone else and it was so flattering i gave it another try. i bought it in both the red and the black, and plan to put a stitch or safety pin through the top to keep it closed. it is very slimming and hides tummy/muffin top issues. i plan to wear it with the stretchy knee length maeve pencil skirts all summer, along with shorts and pants. give this one a try!"
"This skirt is great to wear to work. nice medium weight. being cotton, it doesn't get to hot. skirt is lined. nice flattering shape. my normal size 4 fit perfect. love the godets. comfortable. doesn't get all wrinkled from sitting. nice royal blue color."

"I get so many compliments with this skirt! i love almost everything about it. i gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because i find the slit a little annoying. i think it's maybe a little too long (or short, i can't figure it out) but i couldn't pass up this skirt because the pattern is so pretty.

fits true to size, soft fabric, very cute."
"The dress was great! the zipper was just a little tough but over all a very classic, feminine piece."
"/my friend and i both tried on this shirt just to see how it fit and because it was blue. we were surprised how pretty it si on. a little see-through though, but hte cut hits in the right places (i guess we are not too endowed). she ended up buying it so i passed but very feminie work piece."
"Love this button down, but i couldn't make it work. i'm 5'4"", 32b, and usually buy tops in a regular xs or s. i bought this top in a small and it was loose fitting which i liked, but too long for me causing the pleats to flare out more than i liked. the shirt is also pretty sheer, wear a skin colored bra unless you want it noticed. the material was soft and looked like good quality."
"I thought from the picture this would be a light floaty top. when it arrived, the fabric was a heavy knit and the neckline sagged very low. on me (granted i'm a pear) the bottom layer hugged my tummy and rear in a very unflattering way. the only thing i liked was the color. back it went."
"Tried this on at my local retailer, the red color is pretty but not a ""true"" red. the fabric has a nice weight to it not the usual thin stuff that retailer seems to offer these days. two big problems though- the top is very low cut and i could see it ""opening"" up to the world! and the armholes are cut so big and low that you could see the sides of my bra, this is a deal-breaker for me, it can't be fixed."
"I ordered one of the xl in the red version. the fit is true to size. it matches the model's photos. the color is much prettier in person. it looks washed-out on my computer. but, in person, it's a nice light red. the quality of the material is okay. not as good as with the floral version of this style (florascura tank). the layers are flattering for my pear-shape. it definitely needs a tank underneath though. not worth full-price in my opinion but worth getting on sale."
Adorable dress. could hardly get the zipper up in my very typical size 4. i will order a 6 and am hoping it will work out!
"This dress is very cute and fits quite well. you don't have to wear a bra with it, which is awesome, and it has delightful pockets. the downside is that the fabric on the top half is a little weird. it is very heavy and stiff. also, the inside has some fraying and the quality does not seem to be the best. i'm keeping it though."
"I love the unique design of this dress.  it also has a nice thick material.  the top part runs small.  i'm normally between size 6 and 8.  i bought this dress in size 10 and the top part is still snug, whilst size 12 is too loose.  the bottom part has a nice flowy material with pockets.  since the top part is snug, it will best not to wear a bra plus the thick material will provide a nice support.  the down side of this dress is that the straps are running long.  i have a short torso, so there's"
"This top isn't so much on the hanger but very cute once you try it. the neckline is really cut low so a pin or stitch is necessary. the length on the regular is perfect for my shorter body. if you have a long torso it might not work for you. love how the layers conceal but do not overwhelm your body.  i purchased my regular size medium in black. for reference: 5'6"", 145 lbs, 34dd."
Love love love this skirt. i walked into retailer in august not looking to buy this skirt even though i saw it in the catalog and thought it was cute. once i tried it on i fell in love. i purchased both black and blue. super flattering and true to size. its a must have for sure.
The design on this dress is so cute. it runs really small. i had to go up from my normal size 4 to a 6. i am not well endowed so the top was great on me. it's looks great on once k got a size that works.
"This skirt is everything i love about retailer. the fit, style and quality are amazing. i feel like a am wearing a piece of art. it is so unique and fits perfectly. way to go retailer!!"
Gorgeous skirt. runs a bit big.  well made. perfect for the office and super comfy.
"I wish that it had fit me better as the feel of the fabric and the color were great! regrettably, i am sending it back as the v opening is too low for my tastes and the fabric on the left of the first layer drapes weird on me. i am usually a s or m and in this top the s was plenty of length and room, would be swimming in a m. the fabric was soft and felt great against your skin and not thin as some fabrics can be. the color was just as shown and beautiful. hope it works for some of you out there"
"This is one of the best date night tops i've seen in a while. i'm 5'6, 120 lbs and the xs is perfect. the fit is spot on and the fabric feels nice. i will need a teeny tiny safety pin to keep the front closed, but i do that often so i don't see it as a design flaw."
"Despite being a knit, this skirt holds its shape and is absolutely perfect. it goes with everything and is extremely comfortable."
"I tried this dress on in my local retailer and was pleasantly surprised. it fit!!!...and looked cute. as other reviewers have mentioned, it runs small, but it is super stretchy, especially in the top portion. with that said, it accommodated my bust! i have a 32g bust, and it possess a problem for me when i try to buy dresses. the top of this dress is pure elastic, so it works. the dress stretches on top, but comes back inward on the body?so i can show off my curves. i have no idea what bra i can w"
Unexpected delight! great top that can be dressed up or down. the only con is a little small through the bust.
"Love this shirt, very flattering fit on my pear shape. also accommodates my larger 32dd bust without straining on the buttons. ever so slightly sheer fabric, but no cami needed if wearing a nude bra."
"The color, design and fabric of this top (got it in the red) were just as i expected, but as the owner of several deletta brand tops, i was very surprised to find that my usual size small runs very large in this tank. not only did the front dip too low but so did the arm holes, and the top just hangs on me. it was so big for a small that it almost made me think it had been mislabeled and was really a size large. 
bummed to return it because i really love the color and the style. will try an x-s"
"I bought this yesterday and love it. it drapes beautifully. it's a little fancy but versatile enough that you could wear it for semi-casual occasions. the first tier hits at the natural waist, while the second tier hits at about hip height. this is very flattering for the waist, while still being drape-y and a bit loose. i thought this fit a little bigger than to size. i am currently postpartum boobed so i am 5'4"", 135 lbs and 34dd and the s fit great. (i am currently a s in other retailer tops)."
I have been wanting to incorporate button down blouses into my wardrobe for months but hadn't found any that caught my eye. leave it to retailer to supply the best alternative to a classic look. i love everything from the bottom flare to the way it cinches my waist. i would say this is perfectly appropriate for a business setting while still giving you individual style.
"So, so cute. totally flattering. but the seams don't lie flat and there are loose threads all over the place. i've had issues with quality from retailer for a while (random holes in things) and was disappointed this fit that bill. i'm keeping it anyway because it's so cute!"
"Super flattering! my mom and i both bought this, and we have very different body types. (we both had to size up a bit, as i have a large chest, and she has a large ribcage.) i got a size 10 (i'm normally a size 8), and she got a 12. it was much easier to zip up without bras on, and it seems to have been designed to not need a bra. my mom is pretty short (5""2'), so she's going to get her straps shortened. for reference, i'm about 5'9"". hope this helps!"
"I bought the grey and white plaid shirt in a large. i'm 165, 36d and the top closes without gaping - even when i push my shoulders back. it's kind of sheer, so will wear a cami underneath. the waist nips in right where it should - giving a trim silhouette. adorable and fun top, without being cutesy. love tylho tops!"
Super cute and flattering!
"First, i love this top overall. it is simple and classic and has a flattering, forgiving cut. i agree there is a major design flaw as other reviewers have mentioned. the v-neck is so deep and falls so low you need to wear a camisole underneath. instead i chose to take a stitch at the neckline to keep it together where i wanted it, and that worked beautifully. i think the top should have included either a small button or snap to hold the neckline up properly or should have been stitched together"
"Based on previous reviews i ordered this shirt in both a small and medium. i have fairly broad shoulders, and thought i might not fit my usual small (if it helps for reference, i am 5'6"", 123 lbs, and wear a 32c bra). i first tried on the small and didn't even bother opening the medium. i have a hard time finding blouses that fit in the torso without pulling at the bust (i think this is more related to my wide shoulders as opposed to actual bra size). with this blouse the buttons don't pull at a"
"This top is adorable, especially the grey check. timeless staple, with a modern & cute update. i agree with 2nd reviewer; i don't think this blouse pulls or is tight in the chest. i'm also a 34d, i got a small, it fits perfectly & i wear it all the time - i think it's great for every season. very flattering, the peplum hits at just the right spot and defines the waist. i get compliments all the time. i pair it with cropped sweaters when it's cold. the grey does seem a bit higher quality; the blu"
"Buy this skit- it's everything that retailer used to be. great pice, work appopriate, and it fits great."
Wow im really glad i didn't listen to the negative reviews! in ordered this top in the black and red and i have to say this is one of my favorite tops! the neck line i agree does need to be secured. i wish they would have added a snap. it's fine though as i don't mind sewing it closed. this top is worth it! i'm 5'2 108 lbs and small chested. so for slim girls i think this is perfect!
I really like this shirt. the material was a little heavier cotton than i expected in looking at the picture which is good otherwise it could look like you slept in the shirt. it is something that is going to wrinkle when you wear it so if that is bothersome then pass on this shirt. it's a bit longer which i also like because it will work by itself or under a jacket or sweater.
I found this skirt to run tts - i am a size 16 and the bought the xl. it is so soft and comfortable and the colors are so much prettier in person. i paired it with a black turtle neck and black dolce vita booties that i snagged on sale at my local retailer. happy girl!
This sweater is comfortable yet still work appropriate. the ruffled shoulders adds a feminine touch.
"I have a shorter torso and so i usually love dresses that hit right at my waist- so this dress seemed perfect! 
i ordered a size 2 petite, which fit very well. the regular two (in picture) was not as well made. the straps didn't fit as well. they were less of an ""x"" and way more fabric. petite fit great. i think this dress is really fun but not very mature. i returned it because it didn't feel adult enough for the event."
"Just picked this up in black in the store. on the hanger it looks like just another v-neck tank, but it is quite flattering on. however, the v-neck is quite exaggerated and loose, i will be pinning it so it doesn't sag open. :)"
"I love jeans!!! especially this pair. perfect fit, hugs in all the right places. perfect length! worn it 3x already! and it gets better every time you wear it. goes great with a cute too!"
"This dress is made of a very thick material both on the top and bottom, making it very flattering. lots of compliments!"
This is a nice lightweight summer top to wear with a pair of shorts. it is low cut though - lower than i expected so i wear a tank underneath it. the layers are flattering.
"This shirt was so weird?it does not fit like the photo at all. there seems to be missing a stitch or something at the top as it is wide open until the bottom/where it meets the other layer. i could wear a tank/camisole underneath, but it still just did not fit right. i do not have a large chest, but this was ridiculous. beyond that, the red color was just okay. even though i purchased this on sale, it was not worth the price and i returned."
"I saw this dress and immediately started daydreaming about wearing it while honeymooning in italy along the amalfi coast or the cinque terre with my husband. and then i tried this dress on and immediately woke up. the cut is a disaster, the quality is terrible, and the dress just plain didn't work. the strips of elastic were sewn unevenly, giving the appearance that there was one large breast and one non-existent breast. the neckline was so long that it had to have the elastic run over the outsi"
"This blouse is pretty sheer, but perfect for a summer day. good coverage in the front and under arms on the sides for limited bra exposure, and a very cute opening in on the lower back."
"Right out of the bag, this top didn't really match the one pictured here (it is the right top, though). the fabric was heavy and felt ""damp"" -- the way something feels coming out of the wash. very odd.
and the fit is nothing like what's shown on the model. the ""v"" is not fitted or nicely wrapped (or even tacked in place) -- it was just two loose, droopy pieces so most of my bra was showing no matter how many times i put the pieces back where they belonged (i'm neither ""flat chested"" nor ""busty"""
I love this dress! perfect for both work and play and can be worn in all seasons thanks to the sleeves.
"This skirt caught my eye immediately. i love the beautiful patterns and colors. i'm currently pairing it with a charcoal grey top, which works well. the only slight concern is the material is a little poofy. i still love it, and definitely recommend this standout piece."
I was surprised and impressed by how well made this top is. it looks and feels expensive and of good quality. it is a very flattering fit for someone like me who is small on top and wider at the hips area. i look forward to wearing this top all through the fall/winter/holiday seasons!
"So cute and so adorable but too short for my body in size small. i'm going to try a size medium.
fabric is a nice weight cotton. lining is good, sleeves are a not too tight."
"It really is such a cute romper. took it on s trip to italy and it was airy and comfortable. that is in till i washed it. i'm in europe so there aren't dryers... washed it in cold water, line-dried it and it shrunk. significantly. it still fits but the top doesn't blouse over like it previously did. and the shorts feel really short. so disappointed. my advice would be to hand wash it in very cold water"
"Beautiful, flattering dress. love that you can where a bra without having to be concerned about straps showing. very happy with purchase. highly recommend."
"I'm so excited about this dress! it's perfect for the summer. the material is so soft and lightweight, with a great lining. i ordered a small petite and it fits great! the ruching in the front isn't overdone, so you don't have to worry about adding bulk in the midsection. no problem with my bra (32dd) showing in the back either."

I was really happy when i saw this romper online and ordered it right away. unfortunately being larger chested i thought i would size up to a medium. bad choice. now i have a beautiful romper that is too big for me. i will be getting this one tailored.
"This romper is cute, well-made and true to size, but i haven't figured it out how to put this on without having someone tie the back ties. which pretty much means that going to the bathroom is not an option while you have this romper on. not sure what the designers were thinking here. i'm returning this one."
"This is a beautiful sweater, but if came up weirdly high on me in back, higher than it looks on the model. she must have on high waisted pants."
"Super long even at 5'7"" and a little too voluminous for my taste. incredibly comfortable and beautiful pattern though. i'm having a hard time imagining there getting much use for me, so even at the sale price they're going back."
"I was so excited to order this dress, had the perfect red shoes to go with it. unfortunately i could have been nine months pregnant and still wear the small. i am 5'4/118lb and it was like a maternity dress. sad to send it back."
"These are the most comfortable pants i own. i bought them in the gold, green, and gray (which really does look more like a grayish purple). the gold is my favorite - it goes with so many things! i was just checking to see if there were any other colors - would love them in black and a burgundy. i'm about 125 lbs,, 5 foot 7, and the 28 is a perfect fit. the saleswoman warned that they would stretch out, but i haven't found that to be a real problem."
Glad i got this on sale. it is more yellow than the photo & short. it is also heavy with a sueded interior. would have given more stars if it was less boxy & longer.
"Love these pants! super comfortable, but feel high quality. i am usually a size 2 and the xs fits perfectly."
"130 lb, 5'5, 32dd. ordered xs. this dress is a bit outside my normal retailer style, but i love tracy reese designs and it had good reviews so i decided to give it a try. i could not be more pleased with this decision. as some of the other reviewers have said, the dress is very well made. the lining in particular is excellent- it is a soft mesh that prevents the dress from clinging, without adding bulk in the hot summer weather. i typically wear more structured dresses, but the lining on this dres"
"As most other reviewers stated, the skirt does run a bit large and long. however, it is nothing a tailor can't fix! i plan on getting it taken in to fit higher up on my waist to make it both smaller and hit closer to below my knees rather than mid-calf. the elegance of the skirt can be dressed up or down depending on what top/shoes you pair it with. it feels well made and the coloring is much better in person than in the picture!"
"I really wanted to like this dress and was so disappointed when it came in the mail. if you have any sort of hips, the light pattern in the middle doesn't do you any favors. this made my hips look soooo wide! and the seaming and gathering in the middle was just off. if it was one continuous piece of fabric it might look better. with the seam, the pattern was cut up and looked pieced together. that just drew too much attention to my stomach and hips. it had to go back."
"The first reviewer summed up many of my thoughts exactly. i don't like to go without a bra and this dress with its slightly wider, almost cap-sleeve straps solves my problem perfectly. i love this neckline and wish i'd see it in more maxi dresses! the crossover and cutouts in the back mimic the lines of a traditional indian sari blouse and skirt, again without sacrificing bra coverage. just a beautiful and inspired design - definitely a standout in the sea of summer maxi dresses i've seen. i lov"
"I love the bohemian look and fell in love when i saw this dress when i saw it online. it's pricey but i am holding on to it because it's really beautiful. i got a medium. i'm 5'2"", medium built. it's just perfect. i'm tempted to get the petite but with petite, the top gets to be too short so i think i'll stick with regular size. my family loved it! the quality and detail in the dress is just gorgeous! you can easily dress this up or down."
"I am almost always an xs in bottoms (sz 0-2) but literally couldn't get the stretchy waistband (no zip or fastening) in xs up my hips. in addition, the ""brocade"" is a very lightweight polyestery, tinselly weave--does not suggest quality. as others have noted, it also runs short; i'm 5'3'' and this was a little below knee length on me, not ankle-length. i've had luck with retailer's sale section in the past, including some items that didn't always start off with the best reviews, but have no regret"
"This dress is extremely comfortable and easy to wear with a bra. the back is great and the length is perfect for me. it's flattering, but the pattern (being light in color across the middle) isn't particularly flattering on your waist. that being said though, the gathering in front is great for hiding bumps and whatnot (after 3 kids that's important to me). lightweight and great for summer. 5'8"", 135lbs and the size s fit perfectly."
"I love this top! fits true to size. tunic length, thin comfy fabric, adorable subtle print. the perfect top!"
"This is my first ever review! these pants are 5-star fantastic. ordering additional colors because i love these so much and am finding i want to wear them every day. i initially ordered the bronze color which is superb, just beautiful. i was worried it might be too bright to wear to work, or be a different hue in real life, but they look just like the picture. to my happy surprise they dress up easily. it's a really rich color that i have been able to pull off at work with long sweaters and boot"

I feel like an indian goddess in this dress! lots of swing to it!
"I loved this dress the minute i tried it on and am actually really sad that i had to return it. however, the embroidery was unraveling in several places before i'd even worn it, so i thought it would probably only get worse. too bad because it's gorgeous and flattering!"
"This romper originally caught my eye in the beginning of the summer with the sweet back bow detail. i had originally planned to purchase for a trip to paris in june, but waited until the last minute and my size wasn't immediately available at my local store. i had honestly forgotten about the romper until i noticed it recently in the sale section ... at that price i couldn't pass it up. again it wasn't available in my size at the store location, but they were able to ship it w/in a few days. i p"
"Love the unique details and neutral color scheme. top is boxy but i liked the way it looked on my 5'2"" 115 lb. frame. it's comfortable and well made. thicker material.  seems to be holding up fine after one washing.  looks great with skinny jeans.  highly recommend!"
"Lovely assemblage of prints, looks great in motion. but the waistband runs a touch large. if you're between sizes, maybe size down."
The little details are just beautiful. the embroidery and tassels are so cute. loose fitting just floats over the body. feels very light.
"I really loved this top the minute i put it on. read the other reviews but it really worked for me. i am 5'3"", 36dd, athletic build and the m fit perfectly with a nice roomy fit. top will be perfect for my upcoming trip to tahoe. plan to wear with light denim, dark denim, and black cropped denim bottoms. even looks great with a culottes or denim skirt. the weight is really nice and it washed nicely. i washed on delicate, and laid flat to dry. a little pressing and good as new. it has a nice boze"
"If you happen to get a size that fits you, you will love these leggings. they are true to size when the quality control works. i got 2 pair, both in size 28 - one fits perfectly and the other fits like my mothers high waisted jeans! the material is very soft and comfortable. also, not sure who named these colors, but the grey is really light purple and the dark grey is dark purple."
Flattering dress that looks great on. the back cut out shows some skin while still covering up a bra. the petite size fits true to size
"I've been wanting to add some cords to my wardrobe and had to give these a try. i ordered the blue color on-line in size 31. i'm somewhat in-between size 30 and 31 in jeans right now, so i thought i'd be on the safe side and go up. i ended up keeping these and i'm happy with my purchase, although i do feel like the cut of the leggings is a bit off for me. i am a proportional hour-glass shape and i found these leggings to be quite snug in the thigh, while being oversized in the waist.
in the end,"
"I really wanted the dark grey, but it has been sold out in my size for many months. i finally ended up with the navy. i think they are much cuter in person, the color nicer also. i think the cuffs have been folded under in some of the pictures of the models making the shape look just a tad odd. i got my usual size, and the fit was perfect. they stretch just enough. i would get the second pair in a heartbeat."
"Loved this dress and ordered it based on glowing reviews. ordered size large because i weigh 155 pounds and have a large 34g bust. the dress skimmed nicely over my body but the baby doll style fit loosely and made me look really wide from the side. i probably could have sized down for a better fit, but it might have just emphasized my bust. the fabric has a substantial weight and it's lined. best as a fall, winter dress. the embroidery is beautiful. i disliked the intense black color around my f"
"I ordered a petite small. i'm 5'3, 135 lbs and 34b and the length was perfect and the fit was great. like the previous reviews. love you can wear a bra with it."
I love this dress so much! i got petite and the length was perfect. it was so soft and so pretty. perfect for a wedding.
"Soft, comfy, flattering, just a beautiful dress. it works for any occasion. i can't express how much i love it!"
I'm a 32ddd and this top fit perfect. i wore it with boyfriend jeans and flats. the material is nice and perfect for fall
"The romper is well made and just plain cute. i bought it the second i saw it and don't regret my impulse buy one bit. 135 5'5"" and the small fit perfectly."
"I have been searching for great bra friendly maxis and the design and colors of this one are exactly what i was looking for. i love how the front and back dip down and the open back with crossover detail is really sleek looking.  overall, it's tts, but the chest is a little low cut, so some will want to size up for extra coverage.  the fabric is a silky jersey made of mostly rayon (95%) and spandex (5%) with a mesh nylon/spandex lining from the top through where the cream color ends at the botto"
"Ordered a l and xl, the sleeves were so tight on both sizes but the rest of the shirt was wide and loose. the tight sleeves were not proportional with the rest of the shirt. both sizes had to be returned."
"I'd give this dress 6 stars if i could, it's possibly the best dress i've bought at retailer in 12 years of shopping there.  the fit is fantastic with the ruching around the waist adding camouflage  for anyone with a bit of a tummy. the cross back stamps hide a bra effortlessly (even those wide supportive bra straps that larger cupped women need to wear), the mature rial is soft and silky to the touch, the fit is true to size, the pattern is bohemian and elegant -- not hippy dippy at all. i'm 5'6"""
"Hahaha! as gorgeous as this piece is, i look absolutely ridiculous in it. i am 5'7'' 115 lbs but have a long torso and so the crotch area is, well, a little unflattering to say the least:) i am really sad because i shy away from shorts due to my year round pale skin, but this fabric and color worked really well for me. the length of the shorts is also nice and the back is beautiful! i've never had a romper and i was truly hoping this one would be the one for me. it is all round perfect...if you"
"This dress had beautiful details, and the material was better than i expected; however, it was huge! it completed swallowed me. i am 5'1 about 106 pounds with quite a bit of muscle. i ordered a 00p and it still looked like a sack."
"I wanted to love this, as it seemed like a fun and carefree take on a little black dress.

but how did i not see that this has tassels? but they're there, a whole row of them - look hear the bottom of the skirt part, between the colorful stripes and the lacy area. that's a deal breaker for me - i really can't stand the way these look, and they're not the sort of thing you can easily remove.

the fabric, though nice quality, has no stretch at all. i wasn't expecting stretch, but i'd just say"
This might be one of my new go to tops. looks cute with jeans and a sweater or alone. the arms are snug but not uncomfortable and i think it adds to the shirt.
I needed a dress to go to a reunion party(not hs) and this fit the bill perfectly. it fits perfectly and its short but not too short. it is a great work dress or change your accessories and its  perfect for out to dinner.
"These are really great legging style cords. you can wear them without worrying about covering your bum in my opinion! they are not too bulky at all which you might expect in a corduroy pant. they are a tad loose in the waist area unfortunately but fit me well in the thighs, so i don't think sizing down would work for me. i bought the bronze, and it's a very versatile color! darker than the picture, but still a good color. i feel it will be perfect for fall and spring especially. i'll wear it all"
"These cords are soft, comfy and my normal size 32 for tts. the length was fine for my 5'9 height. i really like the bronze color, it is almost a yellow."
"I really like this pullover. the design is beautiful, and i love the asymmetrical hem. my own complaint is that the fit is a bit boxy on me because i'm large-chested. it's more drapey than tailored. but it's not overwhelming and doesn't cancel out how much i like it overall."
"The flow and feel of the material is really nice, however, i think it runs large. i ordered a small, and i have exchanged it for an xs, which i am hoping fits a bit better. i wanted the pants to be a bit more fitted around the hips and flow from there."
"This cute dress is swingy and chock full of fun little details.  love the embroidery, colors, crochet lace, tassels, wide sleeves.  don't like that it's all polyester and some embroidery is unraveling so i don't know what to do about that.  size down if your petite or slender.  i'm a med-large (135# 36c 38-27-35) and medium fit great at the bodice/shoulders.  hem hits my knees in regular size."
"I can't get enough of maxi dresses and i can't resist tracy reese. this stunning dress caught my eye immediately, but i was worried that the back cut out at the waist would make my backside look flatter. i'm so glad i took the plunge to buy before it sold out. this dress fits perfectly, it's flattering to my figure, the print is beautiful, the fabric and drape do not cling to my figure flaws and i'm just so happy! for sizing reference here are my stats: 5'3"" 140# 36dd and i purchased the medium"
"True to size. length is perfect for 5'8""-5'9"". soft fabric. not too low cut in the front, but not all covered up either. ruching is subtle and does not add bulk. skirt portion skims curves, neither clinging to them nor poufing out from them. strap design is perfect, covers bra while revealing a touch of skin. comfortable and effortless to wear, very very pretty."
"This dress is so pretty. i loved the details on it. the material was ok. would have prefered a softer material so the bottom part of the dress would have been more flattering. unfortunately, it did not fit me right. i'm 5-2"",34c, 28, 37 and the 4p fit ok. it hit just above my knees so the length was fine. what i did not like was that it was a little too loose around my waist making me look pregnant so unfortunately i had to send it back. i'm so sad cause this is a really pretty dress. you can dr"
"I'm keeping this top bc it was on sale but it does look a little maternity! i wore with super skinny white jeans and 3"" casual heel. i'm short so i needed a little more height to slim me but if your tall and and slender this might work better for you?"
"I feel like an indian princess in this dress! it isn't very forgiving, make sure you don't mind showing some skin - but there's some subtle rouching right at the spot where most of us wish we could hide at all times. great colors; boyfriend loves it."
"Absolutely love this dress. i saw it online and didn't give it much thought and then saw it in the store and it was amazing. the photos really do not do it justice. the embroarding detail at the bottom is beyond beautiful in person. i agree that if you don't want skin showing you will need a black bra or black cami to over the delegate lace down the front and back of the dress. got this for fall/winter in fl and cannot wait to wear it, perfect holiday party dress!"
"This dress is my personal introduction to talented indian designer, ranna gill. i just love this gorgeous, free- spirited dress! i bought the regular medium for my 5'1"", 34f, size 8 figure. it works very well. i will want to wear a black cami, as i'm not comfortable with some cleavage showing (maybe 3/4"") and the open lines of lacy, small holes down the front and back. you might not mind showing more skin though and not need a cami. the top is not very see-through, and the skirt is lined. the re"
"I agree with the previous reviewer that the length is not at all what is shown in the picture. much shorter than that. and while the overall detail of the skirt is very nice, the elastic waistband makes it look cheap considering the price..."
"This dress is great, and looks even prettier in person, the colors are more vibrant. the ruching is very forgiving for the belly and the length is perfect. most maxi's are too long on me, but i ordered a ps and it fit perfect. my only complaint is that it is very low cut, which i was unaware of standing up, but when i sat down at a dinner party, well, let's just say i gave everyone a show :(. recommend wearing a cami or something underneath."
"I love this shirt. i'm 5' 4"", 110lbs, just had 3rd baby so not into tight fighting clothes at the moment. love the loose yet flattering fit of this shirt. the sleeves are not too tight on me and i love the length."
"I ordered these pants after seeing the good reviews, but i don't agree. these are going back. i ordered a small. i'm 5'5"" and 135 pounds. i am usually between a small and a medium in pants, but the small in these pants is huge. i could definitely fit into an xs. but i also don't think they are very flattering and don't like the feel of the fabric. it's too bad. i love the idea of these."
"This dress is so pretty- the colors are vibrant, beautiful pattern, the ruched part in the center hides the tummy!!! the neck line was too low for me, so had to wear a red cami underneath which hid the skin showing parts in the back around the waist. so instead of skin color, it was now red- even more prettier! no body could tell!! got so many compliments!!!"
I was pleasantly surprised when this arrived. it hangs in a flattering way and the red has a nice soft hue. i couldn't believe what a great deal i got while on sale.
"These crops are very well proportioned and fun. the graphic pattern is spot on trend and the unusual silhouette can spice up your pants options.

i am a fan of cartonnier and these particular pants were surprisingly generously cut in comparison to most of the styles i have. i usually need to order cropped pants in tall, but these worked with the regular inseam."
"The linen- cotton blend breathes so well for a hot summer day! the design on the waistline is super cute and yes they are a little long in the leg but that can be a plus+ for vertically challenged girls like me. wedges and platforms are perfect to show off the soft drape of the pant legs. now that they're on sale, i'm snatching up other colors, like white and light khaki- already have the seersucker blue pair!"
I wore this dress to a party once and haven't been able to find an outfit that can top it!
"Cute and very soft, but the elastic wasn't sewn in right. i took them out of the wash and the waistband was a twisted mess. disappointing for more expensive loungewear."
"I love these pants! comfortable, light and can be dressed up for work and down for the weekend. the color is a little more saturated in person, but can't really complain about that too much!"
"I loved this top, however had to return as it does run small. by the time it arrived they were sold out in the larger size. like the quality of cloth and stone, however their products do run a size small."
"As a lazy one, i have to confess i barely leave any reviews even though i rely on the reviews from others to make my online order decision. yes! i owe a big ""thank you"" to anyone who wrote a helpful and honest reviews here :) and thank you!! now it is my time to pay back to the community. this pair of jeans are just perfect - perfect design, perfect fit and perfect material, soft, cozy and hip with a good spirit.. i don't want to take it off once i put on! i am 108 pounds and 5' 3"" ordered size"
"I am just over 5'8""and i found that these pants hit me in a weird spot on my torso, almost creating a muffin top that i don't normally have. in addition, they were too short on me to give the chic and modern look of cropped ankle pants. on my frame, they fit more like capris from the late 1990s. both the construction and execution of the pants are otherwise fantastic."
Adorable and amazing quality. true to size. i ordered a 6 and fit perfect.
Love these pants. super light and great color. they are a bit long though
Very nice top. flattering and goes with everything. i bought the medium in the green but would have needed the large in the white as the white was a little see through and showed more of my flaws. i agree with the other reviewer in that this top has good button placement.
"This is a gorgeous top. very well made with a classy design. it fits true to size from the lower chest up. however, at about the mid-belly range, the shirt widens out and basically allows a 5 month twin pregnancy to comfortably fit in. size xs. i was so sad. for the price, i can't justify taking it for alterations. it would have been the perfect top."
"I purchased this and another eva franco dress during retailer's recent 20% off sale. i was looking for dresses that were work appropriate, but that would also transition well to happy hour or date night. they both seemed to be just what i was looking for. i ordered a 4 regular and a 6 regular, as i am usually in between sizes. the 4 was definitely too small. the 6 fit, technically, but was very ill fitting. not only is the dress itself short, but it is very short-waisted. i am only 5'3"", but it fe"
This shirt has such a fun twist on an otherwise basic jean shirt! i bought this shirt on a whim despite having a closet full of denim shirts... and i'm glad i did! the fabric is the same cloth
"Disappointment city with this one and i am so lucky i had a coupon because if i would have paid the full $128 they are asking, i would be a tad skewed. not just thin material but thin and cheap feeling. doesn't itch but i seriously expected a lot more from retailer. i have noted the name of the designer and have promised myself to never buy this label again. big loser."
"I first bought the red & green at the store. when they went on sale bought the blue & ivory. love, love ,love these shirts! they go great with a skirt or jeans. so happy i got them. the fabric is stretchy, but still fits very nicely. what a great buy, hope to see more of this style again."
"These jeans are well-made, the cut is decently flattering, but on more muscular thighs, it would look nicer if the cuff was a bit higher. the petite on me was just below the ankle, so it just looks like i folded my jeans because they were too long. if you are taller or have longer legs (mine are short on my short height), then i think these would be great. i dind't find them particularly small, but htey were snug (muscular thighs). overall, ok but returning them. (25 p ordered, 115 lbs, 26.5 in"
"Iordered hte petite after trying the rregualr size in the store, and i will have to wear heels with the pants... or get them hemmed... the color choices are all great, i wanted navy, but i have a pair of grey ones that look similar, so i deciced on the netural if my size is stil lavaialble in yellow at sale time, i will be grabbing those as well.

i went with 25, my typical size lately (115 lbs)"
"I ordered these in my usual size and could barely get them on. they fit ike tight leggings. they have spandex that is comfortable and they will probably stretch as you wear them,. i exchanged for the next size up, because the style is great for year -round and the quality excellent. i live 2 hours from a store, i would either order up at least one size or try them on in store."
"I love love love the fit in the corduroy, so thought about grabbing these jeans as well. they fit much pretty well, just the color wasn't quite right. i'm really picky about the blueness of my jeans, and these don't quite match the coloring in the photo. still debating whether to keep them. love the cuff styling and straight leg fit!"
"I love this shirt, it's easy to belt. i just wish it was tighter."
"Finding pants off the rack that fit me is always a challenge - i'm petite (5' 1'), a bit curvy and short-waisted, so many of today's low-rise styles just do not work for me. however, these pants are a better cut and come pretty close to a perfect fit - comfortable and flattering, too. i've actually had pretty good luck with pilcro pants. i always have some gapping in the waist, but it's not much of an issue with these. more than likely whatever top i wear will hide that part. i was advised by th"
"I absolutely love these pants! i have been searching for a pair of linen pants for quite a few years but have never really found a pair that looked good on me until now. i have usually found linen pants to lack shape and end up making me look frumpy but i really love the fabric. well, these pants actually have some structure to them and are still super comfy and soft. i bought the neutral color which is acutually a very fine tan and white pinstripe which makes the pants a bit more classy. i love"
"These are the most comfortable, happening pants i have ever owned! they are extremely flattering and slimming at the waist. i am a size 4 and bought the 4, and they fit perfectly. they are a bit long, but after washing and drying on low, mine shrunk enough that i can wear them with flats or flip flops, and not just heels. my 2 teenage daughters have complimented me on them saying how ""modern"" they look. i bought them in navy and just ordered the grey yesterday. i might go into my local store and"
"I love these jeans, well,i have not worn them out yet so not sure if they will stretch, but just in terms of fit and cut, i really like them. i normally wear ch or ag in 25 or 26. i got these in 25 and they fit perfectly. i love the stretch, great color, not too thin, very comfie. i was worried about too much flare, but not a problem. they are very long, but i am only 5""2 and i will be hemming them about 8 inches ."
"I'm an avid retailer shopper.
i bought this dress for my niece, her style tends to run 
bohemian/gothic.
the style, fabric and overall design/quality of this dress, is something i felt she would like (even though the color is not black).
she loves it - perfect fit. she accessorized it with her usual biker/moto jacket,boots, etc.
but it looks awesome on her!"
"This dress is absolutely beautiful. i was hesitant to purchase it due to the price, but i just couldn't resist. it's so flowy and comfortable. it's quite long on me; i'm 5'5 and have to wear heels so that it doesn't drag, but could easily be fixed with alerations. i wore this to a wedding and received so many compliments."
"Short and wide. the color and print are so pretty, but the shape isn't flattering, at least not to me. might work better on a teen?"
"Kicky looking pants, that i got at a bargain basement steal. i'd be kicking myself if i didn't buy them. can't wait to wear them once it warms up. they'll look great with a lightweight, boxy sweater and flats. i tried on the 4 and the 2 and the 2 is perfect. the fabric has a nice, fluid feel to it. i always swore to my husband i'd never wear plaids, but i guess i lied."
"I'm keeping this blouse anyway. i purchased the olive and it's such a great color. i live in a warm climate and really don't need long sleeves, but since the color is so great and pairs well with a lot, i will keep it."
"I absolutely love these pants. i got the yellow and it is a beautiful, soft color. the fabric is soft and flowing. i am 5'1"", 102 lb and the 0 petite fit perfectly. some stated they are too long even in petite but i disagree. the patch pockets are darling. don't hesitate to try these pants out!"
"I was excited to try something by this designer and decided to order size large. unfortunately, this top just looked very odd. cute from the front but it wings out in the back where the sleeves meet the arms. the fabric makes an odd poof in that area. i do have a large bust and it didn't pull anywhere in the front. i expected it to be soft and drapey but the cotton feels very coarse and doesn't drape well. it covered my behind in back. unfortunately it made me look wide from the side view. i hav"
"I am powerless to resist hot air balloons and had to get these the moment they popped up! the pjs are charming and comfortable. the material feels very satiny. it's hard to tell, but there are small white dots in the midst of the champagne colored background. true to size."
"These pants are exactly what i expected. true to size and color were perfect! they feel so good to wear and love the detail in the sewing. perfect office attire or night out for dinner. just add a fancier blouse. ta da :)
would highly recommend them."
"I will be living in these this summer! i couldn't find them in my local store, so i was pleasantly surprised when i received my grey pair from my online order. the fabric feels so comfortable with just the right amount of stretch and the cut is very complimentary to those of us with athletic thighs. i was so pleased that i bought a black pair and discovered they look adorable with my tall boots and a black boxy sweater. they've already become my ""go to"" pants. everyone should have a fun pair of"
"1. i'm 5'5"" tall, 143 lbs, and 38-32-40 and my normal size 10s fit me perfectly."
Gorgeous dress. perfect for something special. paired with black heels. runs a touch large. i normally wear a small (5'6 and 140 pounds) but i'm expecting so i sized up to a medium and it's very roomy. the sleeves do cap out a little too much but it's just so pretty i don't care! def a keeper.
"The perfect jeans for daytime and bending down with the kids or dressing up later for night. i love that the cuff isn't sewn, so you can choose to roll them down too. with just the right amount of stretch, they are extremely flattering. they are definitely my new favorite pair this season!"
"These pants are so great. i am 5'10 and the talls are actually a hair too long. but no complaints! just wish they made every color available in tall. i had been waiting for new colors to get a second pair and was disappointed they are only offered in regular length. but overall these pants are super comfortable and great for work. as far as sizing goes, i wear a 29 in the pilcro cord leggings and wear a 12 in these."
"I love these pants and have two colors from last season. they are well-made and versatile. however, given the amount they stretch and the summer season for sandals, 30.5 is a tad long for petite. i'll have them hemmed an inch to keep them from dragging on the floor. also, i wish the coral and green came in petite."
"Love all pilcro, this is no exception. very flattering. slim fit but not skin tight. comfy!"
"I am so glad i waited for this to go on sale! this shirt is incredibly soft, with great detail on the fading. i ordered a medium (5'10"", 160 lbs) and it fits perfectly."
Nice length in tall.  order up one size: cut slim in body.  fabric lightweight bordering on flimsy.
"The retailer store had mostly white left of these pilcro linen pants so i tried them on. the main reason i did not leave the store with them is because i could see the washing tag inside the pants as clear as day. the white pants were just too see-through and i was really looking for some casual items to wear to the office. if it was at least lined, these pants would have come home with me. otherwise, i think the fit was tts."
"I had been looking for a chambray shirt, but am not a fan of the typical button-down style. this shirt is very versatile, but is far more interesting with the lace up neckline. i received multiple compliments the first time i wore it. the material is incredibly soft, but i haven't laundered it yet, so i am not sure how it will holdup."
"These pants are flattering and comfortable, plus they are cute, cute, cute. i'm a little too conservative to wear them with a striped top, but with a solid black or ivory/off white top they are perfect. can be work appropriate with a blazer or twin set or ""girlfriends'"" lunch appropriate with a tee or turtleneck. highly recommend"
"I never write reviews but this dress is so fantastic i felt compelled to write one. it has unbelievably gorgeous detailing, from delicate beading and sequins on the bodice to the three layers of the skirt: slip, floral pattern, pleats. i literally feel like a princess/ greek muse in this dress. can't recommend it enough. true to size; i'm 5'7"" and 133 lb and got a size 4."
"This dress looks lovely on the model, but it looks just awful on me!
i am 5'4"" and curvy. the shoulders are cut w/ a weird shape. instead of a cap sleeve, it is like a pointy cap on the side and stuck out on my shoulders. it looks like i am ready to get beamed into space.
the material is nice and the sequins are pretty, but the cut of the dress is unflattering."
"These are great quality and hang very nice. tts. i'm 5'6"" and about 130lbs and the 2 fit and hit just above the ankle."

I ordered the neutral in a 2p. i had to hem them. i 5' about 110lbs. i wore them to wore. they wore beautifully with some wrinkling to be expected with linen. but they didn't look like i slept in them. i ordered another pair same size right after the first pair came and tried them on to find the fit tighter than the first pair. a bit disappointed. debating if they'll stay or get returned. i see the notes about stretching. overall a nice pant for the money.
"It's pretty, floaty, feminine; the photos don't do justice to the prettiness. but the photos also don't show an asymmetrical hem. i understood it runs small so i got two sizes, to be safe, and even my larger size was strangely short-waisted, and i'm short-waisted to start with. maybe i could've lived with that, but both the dresses i received have an uneven hem unlike any i've ever worn or seen before. it's not longer on just the sides; the hem is longer in one spot on the front, and one in the"
"I own this shirt in dark green,
navy, and white.
it is perfect. it drapes in such a flattering way, nice weight.
it shows curves in all the right ways but does not fit too snug, emphasizing every flaw.
and finally... the buttons are placed perfectly so that you don't have to choose between extremely conservative or way too provocative (bra showing).
well done!"
"I like the feel and color of this blouse. however, i was very disappointed with the sizing. i usually wear medium so i ordered medium for this blouse, it fits way too big. it is a bummer because the ""curve"" is not even visible when i wear it."
"I love these jeans and have been wearing them a lot now that the weather is turning a bit cooler in my area. i like that the cuff is not sewn in, so you can wear them with a cuff like pictured, or fully unrolled/down. they are a bit higher-waisted than i prefer - kind of an awkward waist height in my opinion. and they are very stretchy. i was torn between two sizes so i went with the larger. i wasn't sure of how to mark how they fit because they are somewhat fitted/slim in the thigh area, but th"
Very cute. i received many compliments when i wore it. fits true to size (petite 2) with some good stretch in it. i am 5'3 and it was slightly longer than that on the model. it is a little odd that the buttons are all not the same. but perhaps that is part of its charm and it is not noticeable. it is very comfortable and the pictures are representative of what it looks like.
"I ordered this in a size s, my usual size and it fits great. i love the color, style and fit of the dress. the only criticism i can think of is the braided trim on the skirt hits right at my hip and kind of, ever so slightly, poofs out a bit and i wish it had pockets. other than that it's pretty darn cute and i got it at a great price of under $40. so i will wear it as much as i can until it gets cooler. because of the rich color, i can probably wear with cute sweater and booties into the fall!"
"This is a great basic t that works with shorts, pants, or a skirt."
"Such a cute skirt- but impossible to get on. ordered in an xs (i have a 25/26 waist) but could barely get it past my knees to step into. if you have any hips at all, unfortunately this skirt won't work. i was tempted to size up but once i got it on it fit great in the waist and already had too much material to size up to a small."
"So glad i ordered this dress. it fits true to size and is extra soft. i was unsure about the color, but it looks nicer in person. the fabric is a mid weight that hangs nicely. this will go great with leggings or tights and wear into spring."
"It was very pretty,but it ran very big , sadly i had to return it."
"I thought this dress was very cute on the model, however it was way too tight across the chest for me. going up a size would mean it would be too roomy everywhere else. also, fabric wasn't great."
"I like many of you had the same issues. i tried my normal size of xs and s and couldn't get it on. the sales associate looked at it and went and got several size small and they all fit differently. some fit normal and others did not, so i would try on first. i love it when it fits correctly"
"I've had my eye on this for awhile, glad it was still in stock.  really great deep wine color, soft.  more texture and detail than i had appreciated in the picture.  love."
Ugh.  i was so excited to get this dress and for 30% off.  this dress is adorable.  unfortunately the top part is super tight around my girls.  otherwise the fit was perfect.  very disappointed in the top of this dress.
You will love this cardigan. very well made with beautiful details. the sleeves have the same detail as the collar and the back. has darker flecks that will go well with dark pants or cords or jeans. you will love this cardi! wish it came in more springy colors. i only gave it a lower rating for quality because the first one i tried on had a sleeve that was much tighter than the other sleeve. the replacement was fine!!
"Really cute skirt, but difficult to get on! i had to shimmy it over my hips due to the lack of a much needed zipper. i am not very curvy, so if you got them, forget it! i sent back the xs - hope the small is a little roomier because it will make a pretty summer skirt."
Cute skirt but i agree with the other reviewer. you can't get it on! i tried my skinny daughter tried no go!
This is a beautiful sweater! it is not too heavy and the variation in knit from front to back makes not the same old boring sweater. the color is gorgeous.
"I would definitely only recommend this top to girls who are smaller chested. it fits in the shoulders/arms, and then flares out too much at the bottom, almost looks like a maternity top. the material is very nice however - both soft, and feels like it will hold up through multiple washes."
"I just love this dress! the color, the quality, the design - all great! sizing can be tricky however. i sized down due to reading the other reviews, and i'm glad i did - it fits perfectly! this dress does not have a zipper on top, so if you have broad shoulders it might be a little harder to squeeze into."
"I purchased this sweet little cami in all three colors (the black for some reason only available to order in store). the fabric is luxurious and smooth to the touch! i've purchased other silk shells by eloise and would say this one runs small. i'm 5'2"" 125lbs 34c and and typically wear an xs at retailer. this tank was too tight in the chest and i sized up to a small which fixed the problem. i can't wait to make my jeans and bomber jackets for fall just a little more special with these babies!"
"I originally bought this dress in another color back when retailer was doing the 25% off dresses promotion a few months ago. i had seen it on a store associate at my local store and absolutely loved it, but hemmed and hawed at the original price. it was a splurge even at 25% off, but as soon as i put it on i was in love. this dress is so soft. i wore it to see some old friends, and after every hug i received a comment about how unbelievably soft it was! the material is thick enough to have a decen"
"This looked like such a cute, casual skirt when i picked it up but like other reviewers have said, it runs small. i'm usually a xs in retailer skirts but they only had a small to try on. i was able to get it on but did notice it was snug pulling on past my hips. however once on, i couldn't figure out how i'd wear this. i wouldn't pair this with a flowy top but tucking something in didn't seem like a good idea either. between the pleats and elastic waist it will make almost anyone look like they ha"
"This shirt is perfect for me. i have very small shoulders, but i am pear shaped. so the flare on the bottom is welcomed for my body type. i bought 2 colors. i have a similar shirt from retailer a few years ago that was multicolor which i wear all the time, so i am thankful they have repeated this design. also i did get this on sale which is a more realistic price for the quality of this shirt."
I thought it was only me and immediately assumed i needed to go on a diet when i attempted to put this adorable skirt on. it got stuck at my hips. i'm a very consistent size small in dresses and skirts. i actually thought about putting it on over my head but that was impossible. its going back. now i see the other reviews and am relieved that its the skirt and not me! wish i had read them before purchasing. retailer is going to get a lot of returns on this one.
"I ordered this winth some trepidation as the dress looked a bit baggy on the model. i don't typically buy this style of dress because many times, they are unflattering on me. i'm 5'6"" and 130 lbs, in very good shape. the small was perfect for me. a size up would've resulted in a baggier look. the length is perfect, above my knee; not too short, but short enough so i don't look frumpy. the dress drapes beautifully, and i can wear it with tights and boots now, and capri tights and wedge sandals in"
"Ugh. this skirt is beautiful and so well made, but i sized up to a 0 from my usual 00 based on reviews, and it's too large, and now my size is all sold out! if it were the right size it would fit beautifully! i'm pretty much a stick, (5'5, 105lbs) and it does poof out at the hips, making me look a little curvier, which might be an issue for some. but the quality is amazing, and this piece will spruce up most outfits !"
"Been on the hunt for jammie's so gave these a shot. ordered my normal size large. fit well in the waist but i don't like the super wide legs. and they're too long. pretty color and pattern, however, the fabric isn't as soft or cozy as i hoped. i'm retired and wanted pajamas to lounge in all day. these missed the mark for me."
"Facing the mirror--near perfection. high waist emphasizes the narrowest part of the frame--pleats nicely hide any stomach flaws. color is an eye-catching deep mustardy perfection and the interlocking button pattern is creative and beautiful. the problem is the walk away. from that view, the skirt waist finishes just where there's a bit of extra flesh. the cut is more of a long a-line--fairly boxy--and the heaviness of the cotton maintains that structure, so while the look as you approach walking"
